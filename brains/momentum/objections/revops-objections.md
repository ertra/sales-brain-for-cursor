# Momentum - RevOps Objection Handling

## Overview
Objections commonly raised by RevOps (Head of GTM Systems, RevOps lead, Sales Operations) when evaluating Momentum. Focus on: CRM hygiene without chasing reps, forecast accuracy from real data, "fits into your process," and flexibility when workflow changes. See [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, competition, and security.

## Objections

### 1. "We already have Gong / Clari / [tool] for pipeline and intelligence"

**Why They Say This**:
Budget and process are tied to incumbent; they may not see Momentum as additive or replacement.

**Respond**:
"The question is where you want the **output** to live. With Gong or Clari, you get insights and maybe some workflow—but do your reps still type notes and update fields? Do your managers still chase context in Gong and Slack? Momentum is built to **write** to Salesforce from every call—notes, fields, MEDDIC—so you don't have to bug reps to update opportunities and your forecast is fed by what was actually said. Deal rooms and alerts land in Slack so the right people act without opening another app. So you're not replacing intelligence with intelligence—you're adding execution: automatic writeback and Slack as the command center. Ramp said they needed one clear centralized reporting repository and that Momentum cut the time in half for sellers to progress deals and gave them clarity across RevOps and GTM teams. What's the single biggest gap today—data quality, or where people have to go to get visibility?"

**Proof Point**:
- Ramp: "One clear centralized reporting repository"; "cut the time in half"; "clarity across RevOps and GTM teams"; "huge lift for our operations side"
- 80% CRM data increase (site)
- Fleet: "Yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request"

### 2. "We can't get reps to adopt another tool"

**Why They Say This**:
Past rollout pain; fear of low adoption or rebellion.

**Respond**:
"Momentum isn't another tool for reps to log into—it writes to Salesforce and delivers prep and alerts in Slack. So adoption is 'keep using Salesforce and Slack,' and the change is that Salesforce gets updated automatically and Slack gets deal rooms and briefs. Reps spend less time in the CRM, not more. 1Password said the most important thing Momentum delivers is insight at scale—reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields, they're spending their time selling. So we're not asking reps to learn a new UI; we're reducing what they have to do. What would make adoption a non-issue for you—no new login, or something else?"

**Proof Point**:
- Solutions: "Momentum isn't another tool for you to train the team on. It fits into your process by integrating with the tools your team already uses."
- 1Password: "Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling."
- Ramp: "Cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce"

### 3. "Our process changes a lot—we need flexibility"

**Why They Say This**:
Reorgs, new segments, or evolving playbooks; they've been burned by rigid tools.

**Respond**:
"That's exactly the use case we hear. Customers say when they make workflow changes, Momentum is the least of their worries and that it has the flexibility to fit their needs. We've had RevOps tell us they've yet to stump us with a crazy request—they pitch wild ideas and we say we can do it. So we're built for teams that experiment and change. Integration with Salesforce and Slack means you're not locked into our workflow; we adapt to yours. What kind of changes do you make most often—new fields, new stages, new handoffs—and how quickly do you need your tools to keep up?"

**Proof Point**:
- Postman: "When we make workflow changes, I have peace of mind knowing that Momentum is the least of my worries. Plus it has the flexibility to fit our needs."
- Fleet: "More times than not, I have been able to pitch a wild idea to the team and Momentum and they just smile and say 'Yup, our tool can do that.' It's been a year since I started working with them and have yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request."

### 4. "How do we get clean data into Salesforce without overwhelming our team?"

**Why They Say This**:
Data quality is the goal but they're worried about implementation, mapping, or maintenance.

**Respond**:
"We're built for that. Deal Execution Agent and MEDDIC Autopilot populate fields from every call—so you're not asking reps to fill things in; you're automating it. RevOps doesn't need to bug reps to update their opportunities; you focus on strategic work. The result is 80% CRM data increase and a single source of truth. Ramp said it was a huge lift for their operations side and that they got clarity across RevOps and GTM teams. We can walk through exactly what gets written—which objects, which fields—and how you control it so it matches your process. What's the biggest data quality gap today—missing fields, stale data, or something else?"

**Proof Point**:
- 80% CRM data increase (site)
- Solutions: "With automated call notes, RevOps doesn't need to bug reps to update their opportunities so that you can focus on more strategic work."
- Ramp: "Huge lift for our operations side"; "improved data quality"; "organizational clarity"

### 5. "We're not ready to replace our current stack—we just want to fill a gap"

**Why They Say This**:
They want a point solution, not a rip-and-replace. Maybe they have Gong + Salesforce and want something that writes back.

**Respond**:
"Momentum can fill the gap without replacing everything. If you have Gong or another source of call data, we can work with that—the gap we fill is **execution**: taking what's in those conversations and writing it to Salesforce, and routing the right insights to the right people in Slack. So you keep your existing capture or intelligence if you want, and add automatic writeback and Slack as the command center. That's how a lot of teams start—Deal Execution and Slack alerts first, then expand to Retention, Coaching, or AI CRO. What's the one gap you'd want to fill first—data in Salesforce, or visibility in Slack?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Fits into your process"; integrates with tools team already uses
- Ramp: uses with existing systems; "Momentum has become integral to Ramp's GTM operations"
- Pilot: start with one agent or use case; expand once value is clear
