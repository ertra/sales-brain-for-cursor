# Momentum - Sales Leader Objection Handling

## Overview
Objections commonly raised by sales leaders (Front Line Sales Leader, VP Sales, Director of Sales) when evaluating Momentum. Focus on: time back for reps and managers, pipeline and deal visibility without chasing, coaching at scale, and handoffs. See [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, competition, and security.

## Objections

### 1. "My reps won't use another tool"

**Why They Say This**:
Past adoption failures; reps already complain about too many systems.

**Respond**:
"Momentum doesn't ask reps to log into another tool. It updates Salesforce for them and sends prep and follow-up into Slack—so reps keep using Salesforce and Slack and get **less** admin, not more. 1Password said the most important thing Momentum delivers is insight at scale: reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields, they're spending their time selling. Ramp said using Momentum cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce. So adoption is rep-friendly: they get prep before calls and drafts after, and the CRM stays current without them having to type it in. What would make your reps actually want this—time back, or something else?"

**Proof Point**:
- 1Password: "Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling."
- Ramp: "Cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce"
- YipitData: "Call summaries were the best they'd seen"; "reps immediately fell in love"

### 2. "I need visibility without chasing reps and digging in Gong"

**Why They Say This**:
Managers spend too much time assembling deal context; they want one place for truth.

**Respond**:
"That's the use case we're built for. Momentum listens to every call and writes to Salesforce, and deal rooms and alerts go to Slack—so you get 'like a sales manager that stays up 24/7' (Ramp) notifying the right folks when they should be paying attention. One customer said looking at Momentum updates while having his cappuccino in the morning gives him and other stakeholders all the visibility and updates they need without having to ask. So you're not searching Gong or DMs; you're getting the right message in Slack. Managers save 45–60 minutes a day on pipeline review. What does your team do today to get deal and pipeline visibility—and how much time does that take?"

**Proof Point**:
- Ramp: "Momentum is like a sales manager that stays up 24/7 and listens to every call, notifying the right folks when they should be paying attention to a deal."
- Neil Manvar: "Looking at Momentum updates while having my cappuccino in the morning provides me and other stakeholders all the visibility and updates we need without having to ask for it."
- Day-in-the-life (Front Line Sales Leader): "Time saved: 45–60 min/day"; "from chasing clarity → to leading with visibility"

### 3. "We need coaching to scale—I can't listen to every call"

**Why They Say This**:
They want consistent coaching and ramp but don't have time to shadow or review enough calls.

**Respond**:
"Every call gets evaluated—no exceptions. Momentum's Coaching Agent scores discovery, objection handling, compliance, and messaging; managers get weekly scorecards and Slack alerts for missed talk tracks and next steps so 1:1s are evidence-based. SmartClips auto-curate 'Best Objection Handling' and 'Top Openers' so every rep benefits from what's working. Customers say it's like having a sales manager that works 24/7 and that ramp time got cut in half. So you're not listening to every call—you're getting scorecards and clips that tell you where to spend time. What would make coaching scalable for you—scorecards, clips, or both?"

**Proof Point**:
- Owner: "It's like having a sales manager that works 24/7, providing insights we never thought possible."
- Alation: "Every time I show a sales manager the Momentum call summaries, I get one of 3 responses: awesome, amazing, or love it!"
- BDR/SDR day: "Ramp time cut in half"; "30–45 min/rep/week" saved on coaching prep (Sales Leader day)
- Owner: "Momentum substantially increases the probability of reps doing the right things."

### 4. "SDR→AE handoffs are a mess—AEs show up blind"

**Why They Say This**:
Meetings booked by SDRs don't convert; AEs don't have context.

**Respond**:
"We fix that. When a meeting gets booked, Momentum generates a handoff brief—goals, challenges, objections, qualification, and even SmartClips—and puts it in the AE's Slack and Salesforce. So zero info is lost; AEs show up informed and meetings convert. Customers say trust between SDRs and AEs skyrockets. That's all automatic from the same calls we're already capturing. How are handoffs done today—and what's the conversion rate on SDR-booked meetings?"

**Proof Point**:
- BDR/SDR day-in-the-life: "Handoff Brief auto-generated at meeting booked"; "Brief sent into AE's Slack + Salesforce → zero info lost"; "AEs show up informed, meetings convert, and trust between SDRs and AEs skyrockets."
- Deal Execution value prop: "Zero info lost" (handoffs)

### 5. "I need forecast and pipeline to be real—not gut"

**Why They Say This**:
Forecast misses; "why is this in commit?" can't be answered; they want call-backed data.

**Respond**:
"That's what AI CRO and Deal Execution give you. Salesforce gets populated from every call—MEDDPICC, timeline, next steps—so your forecast and pipeline are grounded in what was actually said. Customers say they're making decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before and that they have an order of magnitude better data. You get CRO briefs and Ask Momentum so you understand pipeline, reps, and accounts in real time—and closed/lost analysis so you see patterns behind lost deals. So it's not gut; it's call-backed. How do you build forecast today—and how much is from actual conversation data?"

**Proof Point**:
- Owner: "Momentum gives us an order of magnitude better data than we've ever had before. We're making decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before."
- Dealfront: "This level of insight—across hundreds of customer conversations, delivered weekly—I've never had this in my career. We're making better decisions, faster, with more confidence."
- Solutions: "Decrease the guesswork in forecasting and setting quotas with accurate account and deal data, including churn risk."
