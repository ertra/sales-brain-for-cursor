# Momentum - Common Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections across revenue leaders, RevOps, sales, CS, and enablement—and how to handle them with Momentum-specific proof and positioning. Emphasize: Slack as command center, automatic writeback to Salesforce, "fits into your process," and outcomes (cut time in half, order of magnitude better data, save critical accounts).

## Objections

### 1. Price/Budget: "We don't have the budget" / "This is expensive"

**Why They Say This**:
Value isn't clear relative to cost; not a priority this cycle; or genuine budget constraint. Sometimes "we have Gong/Clari" = budget already committed elsewhere.

**Acknowledge**:
"Budget is always a consideration, especially when you're already investing in other revenue tools."

**Respond**:
"Our customers see payback quickly. We talk about 80% CRM data increase, 3x return on investment, and 30% productivity gains—and proof like Ramp cutting the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce. So the question is often whether you can afford another quarter of reps in the CRM instead of selling, or RevOps chasing updates, or churn you find out about at renewal. Consolidation and efficiency often pay for themselves: one source of truth, no bugging reps to update opportunities, and deal alerts in Slack so managers aren't spending 45–60 minutes a day chasing pipeline. I can share an ROI frame—time to progress deals, data quality, or the cost of one lost deal or at-risk renewal. What would make this a no-brainer for your board or finance?"

**Proof Point**:
- 80% CRM data increase | 3x ROI | 30% productivity gains (site)
- Ramp: "Cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce"
- 1Password: "Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling."
- Owner: "Order of magnitude better data"; "decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before"
- Ramp: "Huge lift for our operations side"; "clarity across RevOps and GTM teams"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would need to be true for this to be a clear yes from a budget perspective—and who else needs to be aligned on that?"

---

### 2. Timing: "Not the right time" / "Let's revisit next quarter"

**Why They Say This**:
Other priorities (CRM migration, reorg, quarter end); not urgent enough; or avoiding the decision. Sometimes they're in a long evaluation with Gong or Clari.

**Acknowledge**:
"Timing is always a factor—and you know your calendar better than I do."

**Respond**:
"The cost of waiting is usually another quarter of the same: managers spending 45–60 minutes a day as pipeline detective, reps updating Salesforce instead of selling, or churn and deal risk surfacing too late. We're built to fit into your process—customers say they've yet to stump us with a crazy RevOps request and that when they make workflow changes, Momentum is the least of their worries. So even a focused pilot—e.g. Deal Execution for one team—can prove value quickly. What would need to shift for this to become a priority in the next 90 days?"

**Proof Point**:
- Postman: "When we make workflow changes, I have peace of mind knowing that Momentum is the least of my worries. Plus it has the flexibility to fit our needs."
- Fleet: "Yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request that Momentum has not been able to easily solve."
- Ramp: "Cut the time in half" — quick, tangible outcome
- Pilot: start with Deal Execution or one agent; expand once value is clear

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's on the roadmap for the next two quarters that might make this the right time—or that we could align with?"

---

### 3. Competition: "We're looking at Gong / Clari / Salesloft"

**Why They Say This**:
Doing due diligence; existing relationship; or they see value in an alternative (broader platform, analyst recognition, etc.).

**Acknowledge**:
"They're serious players. It's smart to compare."

**Respond**:
"The key differentiator for us is **Slack as the command center** and **automatic writeback to Salesforce** from every call—so the right people get deal rooms and alerts where they already work, and reps don't have to re-enter what just happened. We're built to write to Salesforce: notes, fields, MEDDIC, so you cut time to progress deals in half and RevOps doesn't bug reps. We're also Salesforce-native and have a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce—so roadmap and native integration are aligned. Gong is strong in conversation intelligence and revenue graph but app-centric; Clari is strong in forecast process but not conversation-backed; Salesloft has a full engagement suite and Drift. We win when you're on Salesforce and Slack and want execution and visibility in the flow of work—with a vendor that fits into your process and that customers say they've yet to stump with a RevOps request. I'm happy to do a focused comparison on the 2–3 things that matter most—writeback, Slack, or fit."

**Proof Point**:
- Ramp: "Cut the time in half"; "like a sales manager that stays up 24/7"; "clarity across RevOps and GTM teams"
- 1Password: "Insight at scale"; "reps spending their time selling"
- Fleet: "Yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request"
- Postman: "Least of my worries"; "flexibility to fit our needs"
- See [competitors/gong.md](../competitors/gong.md), [competitors/clari.md](../competitors/clari.md), [competitors/salesloft.md](../competitors/salesloft.md)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's the single most important outcome—time to progress deals, data quality, visibility in Slack, or something else?"

---

### 4. Status Quo: "We're fine with what we have" / "We already have Gong / CRM"

**Why They Say This**:
Change is hard; they don't see the problem; or they're comfortable with current tools.

**Acknowledge**:
"If what you have is working, that's a good place to be."

**Respond**:
"Many of our customers thought the same—and then they saw time to progress deals cut in half, or 'order of magnitude better data,' or churn risk flagged in real time so they could save critical accounts. The gap we see is usually one of three: **reps still entering notes and fields** so pipeline and forecast aren't as accurate as they could be, **managers chasing context** across Salesforce, Gong, and Slack instead of getting it in one place, or **CS and leadership finding out about risk at renewal** instead of in real time. I'm not saying you have to change today—but what would 'better' look like? Even one of those—like deal alerts and briefs in Slack so no one has to search Gong—can be a quick win. What would need to be true for you to consider adding automatic writeback and Slack as the command center?"

**Proof Point**:
- Ramp: "Fragmented data and processes"; "we needed one clear centralized reporting repository" → then "cut the time in half," "clarity"
- Demandbase: "Momentum flags risks in real time, enabling us to save critical accounts"
- Owner: "Order of magnitude better data"; "decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before"
- Neil Manvar: "Looking at Momentum updates while having my cappuccino in the morning provides me and other stakeholders all the visibility and updates we need without having to ask for it"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where do your managers get deal and pipeline updates today—and do they want that in Slack or in another app? How much time do reps spend in Salesforce on notes and updates vs. selling?"

---

### 5. "We don't want another tool" / Change management

**Why They Say This**:
Tool fatigue; fear of adoption; or "we already have too many systems." RevOps doesn't want to train the team on one more thing.

**Acknowledge**:
"Nobody wants to add something that feels like more work or more training."

**Respond**:
"That's exactly why we're built to fit into your process. We're not another UI to learn—we write to Salesforce and deliver deal rooms and alerts in Slack, so reps and managers work where they already are. Customers say Momentum isn't another tool to train on, that it fits into your process by integrating with the tools your team already uses, and that when they make workflow changes, Momentum is the least of their worries. We've had RevOps tell us they've yet to stump us with a crazy request. So the goal is: fewer manual steps, not more. Reps get prep and follow-up in Slack; CRM gets updated automatically. What would 'fits into our process' mean for you—and what's made other tool rollouts painful in the past?"

**Proof Point**:
- Solutions: "Momentum isn't another tool for you to train the team on. It fits into your process by integrating with the tools your team already uses."
- Postman: "When we make workflow changes, I have peace of mind knowing that Momentum is the least of my worries. Plus it has the flexibility to fit our needs."
- Fleet: "More times than not, I have been able to pitch a wild idea to the team and Momentum and they just smile and say 'Yup, our tool can do that.'"
- Ramp: "Hassle-free set-up"; "organizational clarity"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When you've rolled out new tools before, what made adoption easy or hard—and who would need to be confident this fits before saying yes?"

---

### 6. Security / Trust: "What about our data? Call recording?"

**Why They Say This**:
Compliance, privacy, or past concerns with similar tools. Regulated industries or strict legal.

**Acknowledge**:
"Security and compliance are non-negotiable, especially when you're capturing customer conversations."

**Respond**:
"Security is a priority for us. We're SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliant, CCPA compliant, with Single Sign-On and a Zero-Retention Data Policy where applicable. We have a [Trust Center](https://www.momentum.io/trust-center) that lays out our practices, and we're happy to work with your security and legal teams. We're also pending acquisition by Salesforce—so we're aligned with enterprise security and compliance expectations. For call recording and retention, we can walk through exactly what we capture, where it lives, and how it's used so you're comfortable. What are the top 2–3 things your security or legal team would need to see to be comfortable?"

**Proof Point**:
- SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, SSO, Zero-Retention Data Policy (company.md)
- Trust Center: https://www.momentum.io/trust-center
- G2: Leader, Highest User Adoption, Best Meets Requirements
- Salesforce definitive agreement: enterprise alignment

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Who needs to sign off on security and compliance—and do they have a standard questionnaire or checklist we can complete?"

---

### 7. Salesforce acquisition: "What happens to Momentum after the acquisition?"

**Why They Say This**:
Uncertainty about product, pricing, or support; or concern about being acquired by a big vendor.

**Acknowledge**:
"It's a fair question—acquisitions can create uncertainty."

**Respond**:
"We've entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce. That means we're aligning our roadmap and integration with Salesforce so that what we do today—write to Salesforce, Slack as command center, first call to renewals—gets even more native over time. For you, that typically means a stronger Salesforce story, not a weaker one. We're not changing who we are for our customers; we're doubling down on the Salesforce and Slack ecosystem. If you'd like, we can share what we can about timeline and what stays the same so you can plan with confidence. What's the main thing you'd want to be sure of—product direction, support, or contract?"

**Proof Point**:
- Company and site: "Momentum has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce"; [Salesforce announcement](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-momentum/)
- Positioning: Salesforce-native + acquisition = stronger native story

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would you need to hear or see to feel confident moving forward with Momentum given the acquisition?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "When you think about revenue tools, are you on Salesforce and Slack—and where do your reps and managers want to work day to day?"
2. "How much time do reps spend on notes and CRM updates vs. selling—and how much do managers spend chasing pipeline context?"
3. "Who's involved in the decision—RevOps, sales leader, CS, finance? What would 'better' look like for each?"
4. "What are you using today for conversation intelligence, forecast, and deal visibility—and what's working or not?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're just looking" with no timeline or next step
- No champion; only economic buyer or only end user in the conversation
- Evaluation driven only by feature checklist without outcome (time to progress deals, data quality, visibility)
- Competitor already in pilot or strong incumbent (Gong/Clari) with no stated pain
- "We're not on Slack" or "We're not on Salesforce" with no plan to be
