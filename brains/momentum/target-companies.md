# Target Companies

## Overview
Momentum sells to revenue organizations that want to turn every customer interaction into structured GTM data—first call to renewals. Target companies use Salesforce (and Slack; Microsoft Teams coming) and need real-time execution, CRM automation, pipeline visibility, and less manual admin. Primary segments are by **role** (CRO, RevOps, Sales Manager, Sales Reps, SDR/BDR, Customer Success Leader/Manager, Enablement, Marketing, Product) and **motion** (deal execution, retention, coaching, executive insights). Proof points: 80% CRM data increase, 3x ROI, 30% productivity gains. G2: Leader, Highest User Adoption, Best Meets Requirements. *Note: Momentum has a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce.*
