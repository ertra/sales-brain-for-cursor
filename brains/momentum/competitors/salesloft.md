# Competitor: Salesloft

## Overview
Salesloft is a leading **AI Revenue Orchestration Platform** that unifies Drift (AI chat), Cadence (sales engagement), Rhythm (actions/prioritization), Conversations (intelligence), Deals, Forecast, Analytics, and AI agents. "Put your wins on repeat"; first touch to expansion and renewal. Trusted by 5,000+ customers (3M, Instacart, Stripe, IBM, Citrix). **Momentum wins** when the prospect wants **Slack (or Teams) as the command center** and **automatic writeback to Salesforce** from every conversation—notes, fields, MEDDIC—so reps "cut time in half to progress deals" and the team works in the flow of Slack rather than a separate engagement/playbook UI. Momentum is Salesforce-native, pending Salesforce acquisition, and positions as "fits into your process" with a sharp focus on capture → structure → move (execute in CRM and Slack).

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.salesloft.com
- **Headquarters**: Atlanta, GA; London; Mexico
- **Key Customers**: 3M, Instacart, Stripe, IBM, Citrix; 5,000+ customers
- **Positioning**: Single Revenue Orchestration Platform; Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Drift, Forecast, AI agents

## Product Overview
Broad platform: sales engagement (Cadence), adaptive experiences (Rhythm), conversation intelligence (Conversations), deal management (Deals), forecasting (Forecast), AI chat (Drift), analytics, AI agents. Purpose-built AI; "first touch to expansion and renewal." Fast time to value (10 days); enterprise-grade.

### Key Overlap vs Momentum
| Salesloft | Momentum | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Conversations (intelligence) | Capture + structure + write to CRM | Momentum: auto writeback; Slack as surface |
| Deals, Forecast | Deal visibility, forecast | AI CRO (briefs, Ask Momentum, closed/lost); signal-based |
| AI agents | Embedded in workflow | Deal Execution, Retention, Coaching, AI CRO agents |
| Cadence / Rhythm | Engagement, prioritization | Momentum: execution and routing in Slack; no full engagement suite |
| Drift | AI chat | Momentum: no chat; focus on call/email → CRM + Slack |

## Strengths
- Single platform: engagement, intelligence, deals, forecast, Drift, AI agents
- 5,000+ customers; strong brand; "first touch to expansion and renewal"
- Fast time to value (10 days); enterprise-grade; Trust Center
- Broad use cases: pipeline creation, team productivity, opportunity acceleration, customer loyalty, tech optimization

## Weaknesses (Momentum Advantages)
- **Slack/Teams as command center**: Salesloft has its own Cadence/Rhythm/Deals UI and workflow. Momentum routes deal rooms, alerts, and briefs **in Slack** so "the right message to the right person at the right time" happens where the team already works—"updates with my cappuccino."
- **Automatic write to Salesforce as core**: Momentum's Deal Execution Agent is built to **write** to Salesforce (notes, fields, MEDDIC, multi-object) from every call—"cut time in half to progress deals"; 80% CRM data increase. Salesloft integrates and has workflows; Momentum's differentiator is extract → structure → **move** (execute in CRM).
- **"Fits into your process"**: Momentum emphasizes "not another tool to train on"; "least of my worries when we make workflow changes"; "yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request." Positioned for RevOps and teams that don't want to replatform engagement.
- **Salesforce-native + acquisition**: Momentum is Salesforce-native and has a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce. Salesloft is multi-CRM capable; Momentum doubles down on Salesforce and Slack.
- **Focused orchestration**: Momentum is "first call to renewals" with a clear story—capture, structure, move—and Slack at the center; Salesloft is broader (engagement, chat, deals, forecast) with more surface area.

## Feature Comparison

|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Slack/Teams as command center | ✅ Deal rooms, alerts, briefs | ⚠️ Own UI (Cadence, Rhythm, Deals) | Momentum: work in Slack |

| Customer retention / churn | ✅ Customer Retention Agent | ✅ Customer loyalty use case | Both |
| Coaching | ✅ Coaching Agent, SmartClips | ✅ Conversations, insights | Both |

| Salesforce acquisition | ✅ Pending | ❌ | Momentum |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Momentum)
- **Slack (or Teams) is the command center**—buyer wants deal and pipeline visibility, alerts, and actions in Slack, not a separate engagement/playbook app.
- **Automatic CRM writeback** from every call is the priority—"cut time in half to progress deals"; RevOps doesn't want to bug reps; 80% CRM data increase.
- **RevOps flexibility** and "fits into our process"—buyer already has engagement or doesn't want to replatform; wants a layer that writes to Salesforce and runs in Slack.
- **Salesforce-only** and values Salesforce-native + pending Salesforce acquisition.
- **Focused orchestration**—capture, structure, move; first call to renewals with Slack at the center, without needing full engagement + chat.

### When They Win (Salesloft)
- Buyer wants **full sales engagement** (cadences, sequences, playbooks) and **AI chat (Drift)** in the same platform as intelligence and deals.
- "Single platform" and "first touch to expansion" with one vendor for engagement, chat, deals, forecast, and intelligence; willing to adopt Salesloft's UI and workflow.
- Evaluation is "replace our engagement and add intelligence" not "add intelligence and automation that fits our current stack and Slack."

### Key Differentiators (Momentum Advantages)
1. **Slack as command center**: Deal rooms and alerts in Slack; "sales manager that stays up 24/7" where the team works; "updates with my cappuccino."
2. **Write to Salesforce as core**: Deal Execution Agent writes notes, fields, MEDDIC from every call; "cut time in half to progress deals"; 80% CRM data increase.
3. **Fits into your process**: "Not another tool to train on"; "least of my worries"; "yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request."
4. **Salesforce-native + acquisition**: One CRM; pending Salesforce acquisition.

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Salesloft
"Salesloft is a full revenue orchestration platform with engagement, Drift, deals, and forecast. If you're on Salesforce and Slack and want your CRM updated automatically from every call—with deal rooms and alerts in Slack so the team doesn't have to live in another app—Momentum is built for that. We're Salesforce-native and Slack is the command center. Customers say they've cut time to progress deals in half and that we fit into their process so well they've yet to stump us with a RevOps request. We're also pending acquisition by Salesforce. If you need full engagement and website chat in the same purchase, Salesloft has that; if you want execution and visibility in Slack with automatic writeback, Momentum is the fit."
