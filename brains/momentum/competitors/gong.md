# Competitor: Gong

## Overview
Gong positions as "The #1 AI operating system for Revenue Teams" and "Revenue AI OS"—focus on revenue graph, specialized AI agents, and purpose-built applications (Engage, Forecast, conversation intelligence). Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Revenue Action Orchestration; 5,000+ customers; strong brand. CRM-agnostic. **Momentum wins** when the prospect is **Salesforce + Slack**-centric and wants **automatic CRM writeback** (notes, fields, MEDDIC) and **Slack as the command center**—deal rooms, alerts, and "sales manager that stays up 24/7" in the flow of work—with a platform that "fits into your process" and writes directly to Salesforce so reps "cut time in half to progress deals." Momentum is Salesforce-native and has a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce.

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Momentum)
- Prospect is **Salesforce + Slack** (or Teams) and wants **CRM updated automatically** from every call—notes, fields, MEDDIC—so reps "cut time in half to progress deals" and RevOps doesn't "bug reps."
- **Slack/Teams as command center** is a priority—deal rooms, alerts, briefs where the team already works; "updates with my cappuccino."
- **RevOps flexibility** and "fits into our process" matter—"least of my worries when we make workflow changes"; "yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request."
- **Salesforce strategic alignment**—prospect values Salesforce-native and Momentum's pending acquisition.
- **First call to renewals** in one platform—deal execution, retention, coaching, AI CRO with one data model and Slack at the center.

### When They Win (Gong)
- Prospect uses **multiple CRMs** or is not Salesforce-centric; Gong is CRM-agnostic.
- Prospect wants **broad sales engagement** (sequences, cadences) as a primary purchase; Gong Engage is a full engagement suite; Momentum is orchestration + execution, not a replacement for engagement tools.
- **Gartner/Forrester** and analyst-led evaluation where Gong's Magic Quadrant and Wave leadership dominate.
- Enterprise already standardized on Gong for revenue graph and full platform with no desire to change.

### Key Differentiators (Momentum Advantages)
1. **Write to Salesforce + Slack as command center**: Automate notes, fields, MEDDIC; route deal rooms and alerts in Slack so the right people act without opening Gong or CRM. "Cut time in half to progress deals in Salesforce"; "sales manager that stays up 24/7" in Slack.
2. **Fits into your process**: "Not another tool to train on"; "least of my worries when we make workflow changes"; "yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request." Built for RevOps and hypergrowth teams that experiment.
3. **Salesforce-native + acquisition**: One CRM; pending Salesforce acquisition for roadmap and native integration.
4. **First call to renewals**: Deal Execution, Retention, Coaching, AI CRO in one platform; democratized GTM data; "order of magnitude better data" (Owner).

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "#1 AI operating system for Revenue" | Strong in CI and revenue graph; broad platform | Momentum is the AI Revenue Orchestration Platform that **writes** to Salesforce and runs in Slack—so reps progress deals in half the time and leaders get updates without leaving Slack. 80% CRM data increase, 3x ROI. |
| "Revenue graph" / every interaction | Valuable data layer | Momentum turns every interaction into **structured data that moves**—into Salesforce, into Slack, into workflows. Extract, structure, move; zero manual effort. |
| "Agents" | Automate follow-ups, pipeline | Momentum's Deal Execution Agent is built to write to any field, MEDDIC Autopilot, prep + follow-up in Slack; Customer Retention and Coaching Agents round out first call to renewals. |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Gong
"Gong is strong in conversation intelligence and revenue graph. If you're on Salesforce and Slack and want your CRM updated automatically from every call—notes, fields, MEDDIC—so reps cut time to progress deals in half and the team gets deal rooms and alerts in Slack instead of switching apps, Momentum is built for that. We're Salesforce-native and Slack is the command center. Ramp said it's like a sales manager that stays up 24/7; 1Password said reps spend time selling, not making notes. We also fit into your process—customers say they've yet to stump us with a crazy RevOps request."

### If Prospect is Evaluating Gong
1. Ask: "Where do your reps and managers want to work—Slack or a separate app? Do you want CRM updated automatically from every call so you don't have to bug reps?"
2. Ask: "How important is it that the tool fits into your existing process and that RevOps can change workflows without the tool being the bottleneck?"
3. Position: Momentum for Salesforce + Slack teams that want automatic CRM writeback, Slack as command center, and "first call to renewals" in one platform.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "When a deal moves, does Gong write the update to Salesforce automatically, or do reps still have to enter it?"
2. "Where do your managers get deal alerts and pipeline updates today—and do they want that in Slack or in another app?"
3. "If you change a sales process or field next quarter, how quickly can your current vendor adapt?"
