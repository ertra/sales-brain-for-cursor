# Competitor: Clari

## Overview
Clari is a revenue platform focused on **revenue operations, forecasting, and pipeline management**—forecast accuracy, pipeline discipline, commit and roll-up workflows, and RevOps as the system of record for the number. Strong in forecast process and RevOps workflow; less emphasis on conversation intelligence as the core data layer. **Momentum wins** when the buyer wants **forecast and pipeline grounded in conversation and interaction data** (what was said and done in every call and email) and **automatic CRM writeback** so the data is accurate without manual entry. Momentum provides AI CRO (briefs, Ask Momentum, closed/lost analysis) plus Deal Execution and Retention so the "order of magnitude better data" flows from every interaction into Salesforce and Slack.

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.clari.com
- **Founded**: 2012
- **Headquarters**: Sunnyvale, California
- **Company Size**: 500+ employees
- **Key Customers**: RevOps and finance-led orgs; forecast and pipeline focus

## Product Overview
Clari provides revenue pipeline and forecast management: forecast workflows, pipeline analytics, deal and commit tracking, RevOps dashboards. Positioned for "revenue operations" and "forecast accuracy." Data typically fed by CRM and process/commit input; limited conversation intelligence as the foundation.

### Key Products vs Momentum
| Clari Product | Description | Momentum Equivalent |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Forecast | Forecast management, commit, roll-up | AI CRO (CRO briefs, Ask Momentum, pipeline/team analysis, closed/lost); signal-based forecast from calls |
| Pipeline | Pipeline visibility, deal management | Deal Execution + AI CRO; pipeline from auto-filled Salesforce + conversation data |
| Revenue operations | RevOps workflows, analytics | Momentum: Deal Execution (data hygiene), Retention, AI CRO; Slack/Teams routing |
| (Conversation / intelligence) | Limited or partner-led | Momentum: core—every interaction captured, structured, written to CRM |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: Revenue platform (forecast, pipeline, RevOps)
- **Key Message**: Forecast accuracy; pipeline discipline; "own the number"; RevOps as system of record
- **Target Market**: RevOps, finance, CRO; forecast and pipeline accountability

## Strengths
- Strong RevOps and forecast **process** narrative; commit and roll-up workflows
- Mature forecast and pipeline management; "own the number" messaging
- Good fit when the buyer is RevOps/finance-led and forecast **process** is the priority
- Recognized brand in revenue operations and forecasting

## Weaknesses (Momentum Advantages)
- **Forecast and pipeline fed by CRM and process**, not by a live stream of conversation data. Momentum's forecast and pipeline visibility are **conversation-backed**—every call and email structures and updates Salesforce, so "order of magnitude better data" and "decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before" (Owner).
- **Limited conversation intelligence** as the core data layer. Momentum's product **is** the data layer: capture every interaction, structure it, write to CRM, route to Slack. Clari is typically process and CRM-driven; Momentum is interaction-driven.
- **No automatic CRM writeback from conversations**. Momentum writes notes, fields, MEDDIC, cases to Salesforce automatically—"cut time in half to progress deals"; 80% CRM data increase. Clari relies on CRM being updated by process and reps.
- **No Slack/Teams as command center** for deal and risk alerts. Momentum routes "right message to right person at right time" in Slack; CRO "updates with my cappuccino."
- **Narrower scope**: Clari is forecast and pipeline workflow; Momentum is deal execution, retention, coaching, and AI CRO—first call to renewals with one data model.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Momentum | Clari | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| Conversation-backed forecast | ✅ AI CRO; data from every call/email | ⚠️ Process and CRM | Momentum: "order of magnitude better data" from interactions |
| Auto writeback to Salesforce | ✅ Notes, fields, MEDDIC, cases | ❌ | Momentum: reps "cut time in half"; 80% CRM data increase |
| Pipeline from interaction data | ✅ Deal Execution + AI CRO | ⚠️ CRM and process | Momentum: pipeline accurate because CRM is auto-filled |
| Forecast process (commit, roll-up) | ✅ Visibility, briefs | ✅ Core strength | Clari strong on process; Momentum on data quality and visibility |
| Slack/Teams command center | ✅ Deal rooms, alerts, briefs | ⚠️ Limited | Momentum: "cappuccino updates," deal alerts in Slack |
| Churn / retention visibility | ✅ Customer Retention Agent | ⚠️ Limited | Momentum: real-time churn risk, sentiment |
| RevOps flexibility | ✅ "Least of my worries," "yet to stump them" | ✅ Strong | Both; Momentum adds conversation data and writeback |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Momentum)
- Buyer wants **forecast and pipeline grounded in what was said and done** in customer interactions—not just CRM and commit process. "Order of magnitude better data"; "decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before."
- **Data quality and CRM hygiene** are pain points—reps don't update; Momentum auto-fills from every call so forecast and pipeline are accurate.
- **Slack/Teams** is where the team works; buyer wants deal and risk alerts and CRO visibility in Slack, not only in a forecast app.
- **First call to renewals**—deal execution, retention, coaching, and executive insights in one platform with one conversation-backed data layer.
- **Salesforce-native** and preference for a vendor that writes to Salesforce and is aligned with Salesforce (Momentum acquisition).

### When They Win (Clari)
- Primary driver is **forecast process** (commit, roll-up, discipline) and RevOps workflow; conversation data is "nice to have" or already covered elsewhere.
- Strong Clari champion; existing forecast and pipeline process built on Clari.
- Buyer is RevOps/finance-led and "we already have conversation intelligence" or don't prioritize it; evaluation is "forecast tool" not "revenue intelligence platform."
- No appetite to change how CRM is populated; want a layer on top of existing CRM process only.

### Key Differentiators (Momentum Advantages)
1. **Conversation-backed forecast and pipeline**: Data from every call and email; auto writeback to Salesforce so pipeline and forecast are accurate. "Order of magnitude better data"; "cut time in half to progress deals."
2. **Automatic CRM writeback**: Notes, fields, MEDDIC, cases written from every interaction; 80% CRM data increase; RevOps doesn't bug reps.
3. **Slack/Teams command center**: Deal rooms, alerts, CRO briefs where the team works; "updates while having my cappuccino."
4. **First call to renewals**: Deal Execution, Customer Retention, Coaching, AI CRO in one platform; Clari is forecast and pipeline workflow.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Best-in-class forecast accuracy" | Strong on process and workflow | Accuracy is better when the data comes from every customer interaction—Momentum writes that data to Salesforce so your forecast is built on what was actually said and done. |
| "Revenue platform" | Focused on forecast and pipeline workflow | Momentum is an AI Revenue Orchestration Platform: capture every interaction, structure it, write to CRM, route to Slack. Deal execution, retention, coaching, and AI CRO—first call to renewals. |
| "Own the number" | Process and commit discipline | You own the number with better data: Momentum gives you "order of magnitude better data" and "decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before" (Owner, CRO). |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Clari
"Clari is strong on forecast process and pipeline workflow. If you want your forecast and pipeline to be grounded in what was actually said in every call and email—with Salesforce updated automatically so you're not relying on reps to keep the data current—Momentum is built for that. We write to Salesforce from every interaction; our customers say they've got an order of magnitude better data and cut the time to progress deals in half. You get CRO briefs and deal alerts in Slack so you're not living in a separate forecast app. First call to renewals in one platform."

### If Prospect is Evaluating Clari
1. Ask: "Where does your forecast data come from today—CRM and commit only, or do you want it fed by what's actually said in customer conversations?"
2. Ask: "How much time do RevOps and reps spend keeping CRM and pipeline accurate—and what would it mean if that was automatic?"
3. Position: Momentum for teams that want conversation-backed forecast and pipeline, automatic CRM writeback, and Slack as the place for visibility and alerts.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "When a rep gets off a call, does your current solution update Salesforce automatically, or do they still have to enter notes and fields?"
2. "When you look at pipeline or forecast, is the data coming from what was said in calls or from what was typed into CRM?"
3. "Where do your CRO and managers check deal and pipeline updates—and do they want that in Slack or in another tool?"
