# Sales Play: Executive Visibility & Order of Magnitude Better Data

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Executive Visibility & Order of Magnitude Better Data |
| **Target Persona** | CRO, VP Revenue, Revenue Leader |
| **Target Company** | Mid-market to enterprise; need pipeline and team visibility without chasing; forecast and strategy from real data |
| **Products** | AI CRO, Deal Execution Agent, Customer Retention Agent, Slack/Teams |
| **Trigger Event** | Forecast miss; "we need better visibility"; new CRO; board pressure; "why is this in commit?" |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion / Competitive (vs. Clari, Gong) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Forecast miss or board asking for "one source of truth"
- CRO or revenue leadership new; mandate for visibility and data-driven decisions
- "Where do we get the truth about pipeline and team performance?"
- Churn or win-rate concern; "why did we lose?" asked repeatedly
- Evaluation of Clari or Gong for forecast/pipeline

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Leadership spends time assembling context from CRM, Gong, Slack
- Forecast and pipeline reviews rely on gut or rep opinion
- Desire for "updates without asking"; "visibility with my cappuccino"
- Quote: "We're making decisions with clarity and speed"

## The Play

### Objective
Win on **conversation-backed visibility** and **Slack/Teams as command center**—so CRO and leadership get pipeline, rep, and account insights in real time without chasing, and forecast is grounded in "order of magnitude better data."

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Order of magnitude better data than you've ever had before. Decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before. Updates while having your cappuccino—not through emails and disjointed Slack messages."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify CRO or VP Revenue as sponsor; who else (RevOps, sales leader) is in the deal
- Current forecast and pipeline process; where does data come from (CRM only vs. conversation)
- Check for Clari, Gong, or manual process

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. Where do you get "the truth" about pipeline and team performance today—and how much time do you or your team spend assembling it?
2. How do you build forecast and prepare for board or pipeline reviews—and how much is based on actual call/account data vs. rep input?
3. When do you typically learn about at-risk accounts or lost deals—and what would you need to see it earlier?
4. Where do you want to see updates—Slack, email, or a separate app?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **AI CRO** — CRO briefs, Ask Momentum, closed/lost analysis, pipeline and team visibility
2. **Slack/Teams** — deal and risk alerts; "updates with my cappuccino"; no chasing
3. **Data quality** — Deal Execution and Retention feed accurate data from every interaction; 80% CRM data increase
4. **Results** — Owner (order of magnitude better data); Dealfront (insight across hundreds of conversations); Neil Manvar (cappuccino updates)

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case study**: [Owner](../case-studies/owner.md), [Ramp](../case-studies/ramp.md); Dealfront, 1Password
- **Proof**: 80% CRM data, 3x ROI, 30% productivity; "decisions with clarity and speed"; "insight at scale"
- **Objection handling**: [Common](../objections/common-objections.md), [Revenue leader pain points](../pain-points/revenue-leader-pain-points.md); competition (Clari, Gong)

## Key Messaging
- "Momentum gives us an order of magnitude better data than we've ever had before. We're making decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before." (Owner, CRO)
- "Looking at Momentum updates while having my cappuccino in the morning provides me and other stakeholders all the visibility and updates we need without having to ask for it." (Neil Manvar)
- "This level of insight—across hundreds of customer conversations, delivered weekly—I've never had this in my career. We're making better decisions, faster, with more confidence." (Dealfront)
- "The most important thing Momentum delivers for me is insight at scale. Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling." (1Password)
