# Sales Play: Deal Execution + Slack as Command Center

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Deal Execution + Slack as Command Center |
| **Target Persona** | RevOps, Sales Leader, Front Line Sales Manager |
| **Target Company** | Mid-market to enterprise; Salesforce + Slack; reps buried in admin; managers chasing pipeline |
| **Products** | Deal Execution Agent, MEDDIC Autopilot, AI Summaries, Slack/Teams integration |
| **Trigger Event** | "Cut time to progress deals"; "we need one source of truth"; "reps won't update CRM"; hypergrowth |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion / Competitive (vs. Gong, Clari) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Reps spending too much time in Salesforce on notes and updates
- Managers acting as "CRM cop and Slack detective"—45–60 min/day chasing context
- "We need one clear centralized reporting repository" (Ramp)
- Hypergrowth or scale-up; need to maintain efficiency
- Evaluation of Gong or Clari but want automatic writeback and Slack as surface

### Ideal Customer Signals
- On Salesforce and Slack (or Teams coming)
- RevOps or GTM Systems lead in conversation
- Pain: data quality, deal progression speed, "reps don't update CRM"
- Quote: "We needed everybody reading from the same sheet of paper"

## The Play

### Objective
Win on **automatic writeback to Salesforce** and **Slack as command center**—so reps cut time to progress deals in half, RevOps doesn't bug reps, and managers get deal rooms and alerts where they already work.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce. Deal rooms and alerts in Slack so the right people get the right message—like a sales manager that stays up 24/7. One source of truth without the chase."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Confirm Salesforce + Slack; who owns GTM systems / RevOps
- Identify current conversation or intelligence tool (e.g. Gong); whether they want writeback and Slack
- Check for pain: deal progression, data quality, "reps won't adopt"

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How much time do sellers spend on notes, CRM updates, and follow-ups vs. selling—and how do they progress deals today?
2. Where do managers get deal and pipeline context—Slack, Gong, Salesforce, or all three? How much time does that take?
3. Is there one "sheet of paper" for pipeline and reporting—or do RevOps and GTM teams work from different sources?
4. What would "fits into our process" mean for you—and what's made other tool rollouts painful?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Deal Execution Agent** — auto notes, field extraction, multi-object writeback; MEDDIC Autopilot
2. **Slack** — deal rooms, alerts, prep before call, follow-up drafts; "24/7 sales manager"
3. **Fit** — integrate with tools they already use; "not another tool to train on"
4. **Results** — Ramp: cut time in half; 80% CRM data increase; "huge lift for our operations side"

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case study**: [Ramp](../case-studies/ramp.md) — cut time in half, clarity, one source of truth
- **Proof**: 1Password (insight at scale; reps spending time selling); 80% CRM data, 3x ROI, 30% productivity (site)
- **Objection handling**: [Common objections](../objections/common-objections.md), [RevOps objections](../objections/revops-objections.md), [Sales leader objections](../objections/sales-leader-objections.md)

## Key Messaging
- "Cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce" (Ramp)
- "Like a sales manager that stays up 24/7 and listens to every call, notifying the right folks when they should be paying attention" (Ramp)
- "Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling." (1Password)
- "One clear centralized reporting repository"; "clarity across RevOps and GTM teams" (Ramp)
- "Least of my worries when we make workflow changes"; "yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request" (Postman, Fleet)
