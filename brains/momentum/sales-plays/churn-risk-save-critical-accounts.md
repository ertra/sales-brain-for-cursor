# Sales Play: Churn Risk in Real Time & Save Critical Accounts

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Churn Risk in Real Time & Save Critical Accounts |
| **Target Persona** | Customer Success Leader/Manager, RevOps, CRO |
| **Target Company** | Mid-market to enterprise; subscription/expansion model; CS and retention are key |
| **Products** | Customer Retention Agent, Deal Execution Agent, AI CRO (alerts), Slack |
| **Trigger Event** | Churn spike; "we need to see risk earlier"; new CS leader; board asking for retention visibility |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Churn or renewal miss; "we found out too late"
- New CS leader or scale-up; need to standardize handoff and risk visibility
- Board or CRO asking for retention and health visibility
- Sales and CS alignment initiative; handoff from sales to CS incomplete

### Ideal Customer Signals
- CS and RevOps in conversation; "we need to flag at-risk accounts sooner"
- Manual notes and cases; "CSMs don't have time"
- Handoff from sales to CS is one-liner or scattered
- Quote: "Save critical accounts"; "get notified immediately of churn risk"

## The Play

### Objective
Win on **real-time churn risk** and **automatic capture** of notes and cases—so CS and leadership get notified immediately, can save critical accounts, and sales-to-CS handoff is smooth with full context.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Flag churn risk in real time. Get notified immediately so you can save critical accounts. Notes and cases write to Salesforce automatically—capture accurate data and give your team time back. Smooth handoff from sales to CS so every customer gets a seamless experience."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify CS Leader or VP CS; who owns retention and renewal process
- Current handoff from sales to CS; where does CS get account context
- How they detect at-risk accounts today (NPS, support, manual)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. When do you typically find out an account is at risk—and what would you need to see it earlier?
2. How much time do CSMs spend on notes and case creation vs. customer-facing work?
3. How complete is the handoff from sales to CS today—and where does CS get account context?
4. Where does customer sentiment live today—calls, support, email—and how do you combine them?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Customer Retention Agent** — churn risk signals; instant Slack notifications; auto-written cases and notes to Salesforce
2. **Deal Execution + Account Rooms** — sales-to-CS handoff; win recap; full context
3. **Holistic sentiment** — calls, support tickets, email in one view
4. **Results** — Demandbase (save critical accounts; analysts don't curate for hours)

### Step 4: Proof & Close
