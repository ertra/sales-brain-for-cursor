# Use Case: Flag Churn Risk and Retain Customers

## Overview
Customer Success and RevOps need to detect at-risk accounts in real time, capture notes and cases automatically, and streamline the sales-to-CS handoff so retention and expansion are proactive—not reactive. This use case addresses churn discovered too late, manual notes and cases, and the need for a holistic view of customer sentiment across touchpoints.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; SaaS, technology, or other subscription/expansion-driven businesses
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; dedicated CS function
- **Characteristics**: Revenue depends on retention and expansion; handoff from sales to CS matters; sentiment and feedback live in calls, support tickets, and email

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Customer Success Leader/Manager, RevOps; often with CRO or sales leadership
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: CSMs, Sales (handoff), Leadership (visibility)

### Trigger Event
Churn spike or renewal miss; “we need to see risk earlier”; new CS leader or scale-up; board or CRO asking for retention and health visibility; sales and CS alignment initiative

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Churn and at-risk accounts discovered at renewal or in postmortems
- CSMs spend time on manual notes and case creation; admin takes time from customers
- Handoff from sales incomplete; CS rediscovers account context
- No single view of sentiment across calls, support tickets, and email
- Leadership visibility reactive; no proactive alerts for churn risk or competitor mentions

### Desired State (After)
- Churn risk flagged in real time; instant notifications in Slack so team can act proactively
- Notes and cases written and saved to Salesforce automatically; sync with workflow
- Sales-to-CS handoff smooth with Account Rooms and full context (decision maker, close reason, product concerns)
- Holistic view of customer sentiment; “capture accurate data and give your team time back”
- C-suite updated via alerts for impactful customers (churn risk, competitor mentions, sentiment)

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Customer Retention Agent (churn risk signals, sentiment analysis, auto-written cases and notes, Slack notifications)
- **Supporting**: Deal Execution Agent (notes, fields); Account Rooms; AI CRO (alerts for leadership)

### Solution Overview
Momentum pulls signals from customer calls, support tickets, and emails to identify at-risk accounts and sentiment; instant Slack notifications enable proactive action. Customer cases and notes are written and saved to Salesforce and synced with workflow. Account Rooms and better CRM data make the sales-to-CS handoff smooth. Leadership gets alerts for churn risk, competitor mentions, and overall sentiment. Result: save critical accounts, time back for CSMs, and seamless customer experience.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Momentum and connect call/email/support sources and Salesforce
2. Enable Customer Retention Agent; configure churn risk and sentiment signals and Slack notifications
3. Set up auto-written cases and notes to Salesforce and sync with CS workflow
4. Use Account Rooms and win recap packets for sales-to-CS handoff
5. Configure AI CRO or alerts for leadership (churn risk, competitor mentions, sentiment) so C-suite stays updated
