# Use Case: Scale Rep Productivity and Deal Execution

## Overview
Sales and CS teams need more time selling and less time on admin—notes, CRM updates, follow-up emails—while keeping pipeline accurate and progressing deals faster. This use case addresses manual deal progression, fragmented data, and the need for one centralized view so reps and RevOps “read from the same sheet of paper.”

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; technology, financial services, SaaS, or other verticals with inside or field sales
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; hypergrowth or scaling teams (e.g. 501–1,000)
- **Characteristics**: Use Salesforce and Slack; deal progression and data quality are bottlenecks; “always trying new things, solving new challenges, experimenting”

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: RevOps (Head of GTM Systems, RevOps lead), Sales Leader; championed with AEs and SDRs
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Account Executives, SDRs/BDRs, CSMs

### Trigger Event
Hypergrowth or scale-up; “maintaining operational efficiency while scaling rapidly”; fragmented data and processes; misaligned reporting; deal progression taking too long; need for “one clear centralized reporting repository”; vendor/permissions/deal routing pain

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Reps spend significant time in Salesforce on notes, updates, and follow-ups instead of helping customers
- Data inconsistencies and misaligned reporting; “everybody’s not reading from the same sheet of paper”
- Deal progression slow; sellers “diving into Salesforce” to progress deals
- Inefficiencies in deal cycle; information incorrect or missing; operations team spends time fixing data
- Tools and processes not agile enough for experimentation and scaling

### Desired State (After)
- Sellers progress deals without diving into Salesforce; alerts and drafts in Slack
- One centralized view; consistent, clean data; “huge lift for operations”
- Time to progress deals cut in half; more time selling, less in CRM
- Clarity across RevOps and GTM teams; AI-driven alerts without overwhelm

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Deal Execution Agent (automated notes, field extraction, multi-object writeback, MEDDIC Autopilot, prep + follow-up in Slack)
- **Supporting**: Integrations (Salesforce, Slack); AI Summaries, Approvals

### Solution Overview
Momentum listens to every call and enriches Salesforce with actionable insights; drafts emails and sends alerts in Slack so AEs progress deals without opening Salesforce. CRM is populated automatically from calls and transcripts; data quality issues are surfaced and the team notified to fix. Result: faster deal progression, improved data quality, seller productivity gains, and organizational clarity.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Momentum; connect Salesforce and Slack (and call/meeting source e.g. Gong)
2. Enable Deal Execution Agent for notes, field extraction, and writeback to Salesforce
3. Configure Slack alerts and deal-room workflows so the right folks are notified when to pay attention
4. Roll out prep and follow-up (Account Briefs, email drafts) so reps work from Slack
5. Use Momentum to surface data quality issues and notify team; establish “one sheet of paper” for reporting

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time do sellers spend in Salesforce on notes, updates, and follow-ups vs. in front of customers?
2. Is there one “sheet of paper” for deal and pipeline reporting—or multiple sources that don’t align?
3. How do reps today progress deals (e.g. after a call)—and where do they want to work (Slack vs. CRM)?
4. Who fixes data quality issues today, and how quickly do they find out something is wrong?
