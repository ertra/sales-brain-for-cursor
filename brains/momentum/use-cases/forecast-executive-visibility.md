# Use Case: Forecast with Confidence and Executive Visibility

## Overview
CROs and revenue leadership need pipeline, rep, and account visibility in real time—without chasing updates—and forecast grounded in what actually happened in calls and CRM. This use case addresses scattered sources of truth, gut-based forecast, and the need for “order of magnitude better data” so decisions are made with clarity and speed.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; any vertical with material revenue/GTM function
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; CRO or VP-level ownership of number
- **Characteristics**: Use Salesforce and Slack; multiple stakeholders need visibility; forecast and board reviews require one source of truth

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: CRO, VP Revenue, Head of Revenue; often with RevOps as implementer
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales leaders, CS leaders, RevOps

### Trigger Event
Forecast miss or board pressure; new CRO or “one source of truth” mandate; “we need better visibility”; churn or win-rate concern; scaling GTM without proportionally scaling meetings

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Pipeline and team insights live in CRM, Gong, Slack, spreadsheets—no single source
- Forecast and pipeline reviews rely on gut and manual archaeology; “why is this in commit?” unanswered
- Churn and deal risk surface too late; “why did we lose?” only in postmortems
- Leadership spends 45–60 min/day assembling context; “I don’t know how I would update key stakeholders without Momentum other than through a whole lot of emails, disjointed Slack messages”
- Reps buried in admin; “insight at scale” missing

### Desired State (After)
- Visibility without asking; “updates while having my cappuccino”
- Forecast and strategy grounded in call-backed, signal-based data; “order of magnitude better data”
- Closed/lost analysis and trend reports; patterns behind lost deals for strategy and roadmap
- Lead with visibility instead of chasing clarity; reps spend time selling while data flows automatically

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: AI CRO (CRO Executive Briefs, Ask Momentum across pipeline, closed/lost analysis and trend reports, team analysis)
- **Supporting**: Deal Execution Agent (data quality); Customer Retention Agent (churn risk); Slack/Teams command center; Integrations

### Solution Overview
AI CRO delivers high-level insights on pipeline performance, rep activity, and account health; Ask Momentum provides on-demand insights on deals, reps, and accounts. Closed/lost analysis and trend reports uncover patterns behind lost deals. Slack/Teams routes key moments and alerts so leadership gets “updates while having my cappuccino.” Auto-filled Salesforce and signal-based forecast give call-backed pipeline inspection. Result: decisions with clarity and speed; forecast with confidence.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Momentum and connect Salesforce, Slack, and call/CRM sources
2. Enable AI CRO; configure CRO briefs and Ask Momentum access for leadership
3. Use closed/lost analysis and trend reports for forecast and strategy reviews
4. Ensure Deal Execution and Retention Agent feed accurate data into pipeline and account health
5. Establish Slack/Teams as command center so alerts and briefs land where leadership already works

## Discovery Questions
1. Where do you get “the truth” about pipeline and team performance today—and how much time do you or your team spend assembling it?
2. How do you build forecast and prepare for board or pipeline reviews—and how much is based on actual call/account data?
3. When do you typically learn about at-risk accounts or lost deals—and what would you need to see it earlier?
4. How do you balance “insight at scale” with keeping reps focused on selling (not admin)?
