# Use Case: Democratized GTM Data and One Source of Truth

## Overview
RevOps and GTM leaders need one centralized view so sales, CS, enablement, and leadership “read from the same sheet of paper”—with data flowing automatically from every customer interaction into Salesforce and Slack. This use case addresses fragmented data, misaligned reporting, and the need for an “AI-powered RevOps engine” that makes the whole organization AI-first and data-driven.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; technology, SaaS, or other verticals with multi-function GTM (sales, CS, RevOps, enablement)
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; often scaling or post-scale-up
- **Characteristics**: Use Salesforce and Slack; “everybody’s not reading from the same sheet of paper”; desire to consolidate and align; experimentation and agility important

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: RevOps (Head of GTM Systems, RevOps lead), CRO; often with Sales and CS leaders
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales, CS, Enablement, Marketing, Product

### Trigger Event
“One clear centralized reporting repository”; misaligned reporting and data inconsistencies; tool consolidation or “one source of truth” initiative; hypergrowth requiring agility; “we needed… making sure that everybody’s reading from the same sheet of paper” (Ramp)

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Fragmented data and processes; multiple tools and spreadsheets; no single source of truth
- Misaligned reporting; “everybody’s not reading from the same sheet of paper”
- Data quality issues; information incorrect or missing; operations team spends time fixing data
- Insights trapped in calls and emails; analysts spend hours curating data
- Existing tools and processes not agile enough for experimentation and scaling

### Desired State (After)
- One centralized view; consistent, clean data; “huge lift for operations”
- Democratized GTM data: “entire organization has insights from your go-to-market motion”
- Data flows automatically from every interaction into CRM and Slack; “summarizes across all the calls without our analysts having to spend hours curating the data”
- “AI-first in the AI era”; “feel like a prompt engineer… feel like a data scientist”
- Clarity across RevOps and GTM teams; one sheet of paper for reporting

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Momentum Platform (Deal Execution Agent, Customer Retention Agent, AI CRO, Coaching Agent, Integrations)
- **Supporting**: Salesforce, Slack (and Snowflake optional); MEDDIC Autopilot, AI Summaries, Signal routing

### Solution Overview
Momentum captures every customer interaction and turns it into structured GTM data; auto-fills Salesforce and routes insights in Slack so the right people get the right message at the right time. Deal Execution keeps CRM clean; Retention and AI CRO feed churn risk and pipeline visibility; Coaching feeds rep and competency data. “Democratized GTM data for your entire company”; one platform so sales, RevOps, CS, enablement, marketing, and product work from the same data. Result: one source of truth, organizational clarity, and “order of magnitude better data.”

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Momentum; connect Salesforce, Slack, and all revenue-critical sources (calls, email, etc.)
2. Enable Deal Execution Agent for automated notes and field extraction; establish “one sheet of paper” for pipeline and reporting
3. Enable Customer Retention Agent and AI CRO so churn risk and pipeline visibility feed the same data model
4. Use signal routing so Sales, CS, Enablement, Marketing, Product get alerts and clips without manual curation
5. Roll out Coaching Agent and ensure scorecards/data feed Salesforce for full GTM visibility
6. Establish Slack/Teams as command center; “Momentum helps drive clarity across a RevOps unit and GTM teams”
