# Use Case: Coach at Scale and Cut Ramp Time

## Overview
Sales leaders and Enablement need coaching that scales—every call evaluated, scorecards and SmartClips so reps and managers see what’s working and what to fix—with a live feedback loop from the field to enablement. This use case addresses “coaching by memory or Gong archaeology,” inconsistent ramp, and the need for evidence-based coaching that replicates top performers and cuts ramp time in half.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; technology, SaaS, or other verticals with inside or field sales
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; teams where ramp and consistency matter
- **Characteristics**: Use CRM and call/meeting capture; managers and enablement need visibility into rep behavior and messaging

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Front Line Sales Leader, Enablement; often with RevOps
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Reps (AEs, SDRs), RevOps

### Trigger Event
Ramp time or win rate under pressure; “we need to scale coaching”; new enablement lead; “we need a feedback loop from the field”; messaging or competitive shift requiring fast training updates

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Managers prep 1:1s by digging through Gong, listening to 2–3 calls per rep; coaching ad hoc and reactive
- No system for coachable moments; SDRs rarely hear what “good” sounds like; ramp inconsistent
- Enablement hears about objection and messaging trends weeks later; no data on which talk tracks work
- “Gong stores the footage, but no one has time to extract patterns or enforce standards”
- Compliance and process adherence invisible until audit

### Desired State (After)
- Every call scored; weekly scorecards and Slack alerts for missed talk tracks and next steps
- SmartClips auto-curated (“Top Openers,” “Best Objection Handling”) for training and self-coaching; zero manual curation
- Live feedback loop: objection and messaging trends routed to Enablement same day; auto-tagged clips for battlecards and training
- Ramp time cut in half; every rep benefits from top 10% best practices
- Coaching data in Salesforce; compliance dashboards and alerts

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Coaching Agent (every-call scoring, scorecards, Slack alerts, competency dashboards, SmartClips)
- **Supporting**: Deal Execution Agent (data); Signal routing to Enablement; Integrations (Slack, Teams, Outlook, Salesforce)

### Solution Overview
Momentum evaluates every call for discovery, objection handling, talk-to-listen, compliance, and messaging adherence; generates weekly scorecards and Slack alerts (“Rep missed 5% service fee talk track,” “No clear next step after demo”). SmartClips auto-curate best moments for training and self-coaching. Objection and messaging trends are routed to Enablement in Slack with auto-tagged clips so training and battlecards update same day. Coaching performance feeds into Salesforce. Result: data-backed coaching at scale, ramp time cut, and “sales manager that works 24/7.”

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Momentum and connect call source and CRM
2. Enable Coaching Agent; configure competencies and scoring (discovery, objection handling, compliance, etc.)
3. Roll out SmartClips and delivery in Slack/Teams so reps and managers use “Top Openers,” “Best Objection Handling”
4. Configure signal routing so Enablement gets objection/messaging/compliance alerts and clips
5. Integrate coaching scores into Salesforce (scorecards, dashboards, compensation if desired) and use compliance dashboards for process adherence
