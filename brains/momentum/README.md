# Momentum Sales Brain

Human-friendly overview of the Momentum sales intelligence in this folder. For AI agents and file-level loading rules, see **INDEX.md**.

## What Is This?

This is a **Sales Brain** for **Momentum**—a structured set of markdown files that capture company info, products, personas, pain points, value propositions, use cases, competitors, objections, case studies, and sales plays. Use it for enablement, competitive prep, and consistent messaging.

## Momentum in One Sentence

Momentum is the **AI Revenue Orchestration Platform** that captures unstructured data from every customer interaction, **writes to Salesforce** automatically, and **routes insights in Slack** (and soon Teams)—so reps cut time to progress deals in half, RevOps doesn't bug reps, and leaders get "updates with my cappuccino." First call to renewals. *Momentum has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce.*

## Proof Points to Remember

| Customer | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Ramp** | **Cut the time in half** for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce; "like a sales manager that stays up 24/7"; clarity across RevOps and GTM teams |
| **1Password** | "**Insight at scale**. Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling." (Navin Persaud, VP RevOps) |
| **Owner** | "**Order of magnitude better data** than we've ever had before. We're making decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before." (Kyle Norton, CRO) |
| **Demandbase** | "Momentum **flags risks in real time**, enabling us to save critical accounts effortlessly." (Mark Turner, VP RevOps) |
| **Site** | **80%** CRM data increase \| **3x** ROI \| **30%** productivity gains |
| **Fleet** | "Yet to **stump them with a crazy RevOps request**." (Taylor Hughes, Head of RevOps) |
| **Postman** | "**Least of my worries** when we make workflow changes. Plus it has the **flexibility** to fit our needs." (Brittany Gonzalez, Salesforce Manager) |

## Key Differentiators

1. **Write to Salesforce + Slack as command center** — Notes, fields, MEDDIC from every call; deal rooms and alerts in Slack so the right people act without opening another app. "Cut time in half to progress deals."
2. **Fits into your process** — "Not another tool to train on"; integrates with Salesforce, Slack, Snowflake and tools you already use; "least of my worries when we make workflow changes"; "yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request."
3. **First call to renewals** — Deal Execution, Customer Retention, Coaching, AI CRO in one platform; one data model; democratized GTM data.
4. **Salesforce-native + acquisition** — Built for Salesforce; definitive agreement to be acquired by Salesforce for roadmap and native alignment.
