# Product Team Leader

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Product Team Leader, VP Product, Head of Product. Owns roadmap and customer-informed prioritization; needs signal from sales and CS on what customers want and why deals win or lose.

## Responsibilities
- Prioritize based on real customer feedback and competitive context from the field
- Understand why deals are won or lost; patterns behind lost deals for roadmap and positioning
- Combine insights across customer touchpoints (calls, support, emails) for holistic sentiment

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Product feedback and feature requests trapped in calls; learned in postmortems or one-off Slack messages
- No systematic view of “why we’re winning and losing”; trend reports and patterns missing
- Sentiment and needs scattered across sales, CS, support; no single view
- Slow feedback loop from GTM to product

## Goals & Objectives

- Combine insights across touchpoints for holistic view of customer sentiment
- Uncover patterns behind lost deals with AI-driven analysis and trend reports to inform roadmap
- Real-time signal routing so Product gets pinged when features are requested or confusion detected

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Deep Research / Ask Momentum** — On-demand insights from calls and accounts; “how did the pitch land?”; patterns behind lost deals
- **Signal routing** — Product gets pinged when features requested; “Integration confusion detected in 4/5 calls” type alerts (from Sales Manager day-in-the-life); enablement and product get auto-tagged clips
- **Customer Retention Agent** — Sentiment and feedback from calls, tickets, emails; holistic view of customer sentiment
- **AI CRO** — Closed/lost analysis and trend reports; “uncover patterns behind lost deals to inform product roadmap” (solutions page)

## Buying Process
Often involved when RevOps or sales evaluates; CPO or VP Product may sponsor. Cares about product feedback at scale, win/loss intelligence, and roadmap impact. Proof: solutions page “always-on product feedback,” “understand why you’re winning and losing deals.”

## Communication Preferences
“Always-on product feedback,” “combine insights across customer touchpoints,” “understand why you’re winning and losing,” “patterns behind lost deals for roadmap.” Alerts with quotes and recordings from customers.
