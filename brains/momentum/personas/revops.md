# Revenue Operations (RevOps)

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Revenue Operations, Sales Operations, GTM Systems, Business Systems. Own CRM, process, tooling, and data quality for revenue teams.

## Responsibilities
- Keep CRM accurate and pipeline reportable; enable forecasting and quota setting
- Reduce manual work for reps and CSMs so they sell and support, not update fields
- Integrate tools into one workflow; avoid “another tool to train on”

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Reps don’t update CRM; data hygiene and pipeline accuracy suffer
- Guesswork in forecasting and quotas; churn risk and deal health not in the system
- Training and change management for every new tool; need something that fits existing process
- Flexibility when workflow changes; audit-ready data for compliance

## Goals & Objectives
- Keep CRM “sparkling clean” with automated notes and field updates
- Forecast with confidence using accurate account and deal data (including churn risk)
- Hassle-free set-up that integrates with Salesforce, Slack, Snowflake, and existing stack

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Deal Execution Agent** — Automated call notes, field extraction, multi-object writeback; MEDDIC Autopilot; 100% improvements in data hygiene (site claim)
- **Customer Retention Agent** — Churn risk and sentiment feed CRM and workflows
- **AI CRO** — Pipeline and team insights; closed/lost analysis for process improvement
- **Integrations** — Fits into process; integrates with tools team already uses; “least of my worries when we make workflow changes” (testimonial)

## Buying Process
Often leads evaluation with sales and CS leadership; CRO may sponsor. Cares about Salesforce/Slack integration, data model, flexibility, security, and time to value. References from RevOps (1Password, Demandbase, Fleet, YipitData) resonate.

## Communication Preferences
“CRM hygiene,” “forecast with confidence,” “no bugging reps to update opportunities,” “hassle-free set-up,” “flexibility.” Proof: cut time to progress deals in half (Ramp), “yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request” (Fleet).
