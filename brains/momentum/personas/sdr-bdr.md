# BDR / SDR

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
BDR, SDR, Business Development Rep, Sales Development Rep. Own prospecting, first connect, discovery, and handoff to AEs.

## Responsibilities
- Morning prospecting and call blocks; prep and messaging that converts
- First connect and discovery conversations; qualification (budget, authority, timeline) and compliance
- Post-call CRM hygiene; complete, consistent data for pipeline and AEs
- SDR → AE handoff with full context so meetings convert

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- **Manual prep, guesswork messaging** — 30–45 min digging in Salesforce, LinkedIn, Gong; inconsistent openers; no visibility into which intros convert
- **Multitasking chaos on calls** — Juggling notes, script, buyer; missing qualification questions; compliance slips; vague next steps
- **Hours of admin, incomplete data** — Manual notes; CRM fields (e.g. budget) blank half the time; managers and AEs don’t trust pipeline
- **Weak handoffs** — “They’re interested in a demo”; AE walks in blind; low conversion on SDR-booked meetings
- **Limited coaching** — Managers shadow 1–2 calls; ramp inconsistent; no “what good sounds like”

## Goals & Objectives
- Spend time dialing, not researching; use proven talk tracks and signals
- Every discovery call consistent, compliant, and fully documented; stay focused on the buyer
- CRM as single source of truth without slowing down; measured on quality and conversion, not just activity
- AEs show up informed; trust between SDRs and AEs high; ramp time cut

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Smart prep + messaging** — AI Account Briefs in Slack/Teams; signals on which intros perform (e.g. “ROI framing” → 27% higher connect); SmartClips “Top Openers of the Week”
- **Signal capture + compliance** — Live flags: qualification, compliance (disclaimers, opt-in), objections, competitor mentions; Autopilot updates Salesforce (Opportunity, Contact, Event); Slack alert if compliance not delivered
- **Automated CRM entry** — 100% required fields populated; multi-object writeback; audit-ready summaries; SDR just reviews Slack nudge
- **Automated handoff briefs** — Goals, challenges, objections, competitor mentions, qualification; SmartClips; brief in AE’s Slack + Salesforce
- **Coaching + SmartClips** — Every call scored (opener, qualification, compliance, objection handling); “Best Objection Handling,” “Top Cold Call Intros”; compliance dashboards
- **Real-time signals** — Objection, competitor, compliance alerts routed to Sales, Marketing, Enablement, Product in Slack/Teams

## Buying Process
Often adopted as part of team/RevOps initiative; manager or RevOps leads. Cares about less admin, better handoffs, ramp time, and compliance. SDRs measured on quality and conversion impact, not just activity.

## Communication Preferences
“Smart prep,” “signal capture,” “automated handoff,” “every call consistent and compliant,” “ramp time cut in half.” Proof from RevOps and managers (YipitData: “reps immediately fell in love; call summaries best they’d seen”).
