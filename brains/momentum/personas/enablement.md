# Enablement

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Enablement, Sales Enablement, Revenue Enablement. Owns training, content, playbooks, and process so reps and CSMs execute consistently.

## Responsibilities
- Equip reps and CSMs with talk tracks, battlecards, and best practices; reduce ramp time
- Close the loop from field to enablement: objection trends, messaging effectiveness, compliance gaps
- Align with sales leadership and RevOps on what “good” looks like and how to measure it

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Enablement hears about objection trends or messaging misfires weeks later; no real-time feedback from field
- Managers guess “are we explaining the product wrong?”; no data on which talk tracks work
- Gong/calls hold the insights but extracting patterns and enforcing standards is manual
- Ramp inconsistent; some reps hit quota fast, others stall; limited view of what top performers do

## Goals & Objectives
- Live feedback loop: objection trends, compliance, messaging adherence surfaced from every call
- Auto-tagged clips and alerts so enablement can update training and battlecards quickly
- Coaching dashboards and SmartClips (“Best Objection Handling,” “Top Openers”) for scalable, evidence-based training
- From anecdotal trends → structured enablement feedback at scale

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Coaching Agent** — Every call scored for messaging adherence, objection handling, compliance; Slack alerts (e.g. “Objection to pricing up 38% this week,” “Integration confusion in 4/5 calls”); auto-tagged clips for enablement
- **SmartClips** — “Top Openers of the Week,” “Best Objection Handling”; used in training and self-coaching; zero manual curation
- **Signal routing** — Objection, competitor, compliance signals routed to Enablement in Slack/Teams; same-day response instead of weeks later
- **Sales Manager day** — “Enablement gets auto-tagged call clips to update training or battlecards”; “From anecdotal trends → structured enablement feedback at scale”

## Buying Process
Often evaluates with Sales Leadership and RevOps; may be part of coaching/ramp initiative. Cares about feedback loop from field, ramp time, and compliance visibility. Proof: “ramp time cut in half” (BDR/SDR day-in-the-life); Owner, Ramp use for rep development.

## Communication Preferences
“Live feedback loop embedded in workflow,” “objection trends and messaging effectiveness,” “auto-tagged clips for training,” “structured enablement feedback at scale.”
