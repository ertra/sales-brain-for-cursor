# Customer Success Manager (CSM)

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Customer Success Manager, CSM. Owns post-sale relationships; adoption, health, renewal, and expansion for assigned accounts.

## Responsibilities
- Manage customer health and sentiment; identify risk and opportunity early
- Capture notes, cases, and next steps from every touchpoint; keep Salesforce and workflow in sync
- Hand off from sales with full context; collaborate with sales and product on expansion

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Manual note-taking and case creation after calls; admin takes time from customers
- Learning about churn risk or dissatisfaction too late; no single view of sentiment across touchpoints
- Handoff from sales often incomplete; CS rediscovers goals and stakeholders
- Inconsistent data in CRM; managers and RevOps can’t trust health or forecast

## Goals & Objectives
- Automatically capture notes and cases; log in Salesforce and sync to workflow
- Get notified immediately of churn risk; take proactive action to improve retention
- Focus on customers, not data entry; accurate health and sentiment for forecasting

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Customer Retention Agent** — Automatically write and save Customer Cases to Salesforce; detect risk signals from interactions; instant Slack notifications for churn risk; sentiment from calls, tickets, emails
- **Deal Execution Agent** — AI notes and field updates; prep and follow-up assistance so CSM spends less time on admin
- **Account Rooms + CRM** — Full context from sales and ongoing touchpoints; seamless handoff and single view of account

## Buying Process
Adopted as part of CS/RevOps initiative; CS Leader or RevOps leads. CSMs care about “time back,” “risk notified immediately,” “notes and cases automatic.”

## Communication Preferences
“Drive retention with real-time sentiment,” “automatically write and save cases,” “get notified immediately of churn risk.” Proof: “save critical accounts” (Demandbase); “capture accurate data and give your team time back” (solutions).
