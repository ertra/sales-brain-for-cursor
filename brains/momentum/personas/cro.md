# Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Chief Revenue Officer, VP Revenue, Head of Revenue. Owns full revenue engine—sales, CS, RevOps, sometimes marketing—and board/forecast accountability.

## Responsibilities
- Own pipeline, forecast, and revenue number; align sales, CS, and RevOps on one source of truth
- Make fast, data-driven decisions on accounts, reps, and strategy; avoid surprises at quarter end
- Keep C-suite updated on pipeline health, risks, and wins without chasing updates

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Scattered sources of truth; no single place for pipeline and team performance
- Forecast and pipeline reviews rely on gut and manual Gong/CRM archaeology
- Churn and risk surface too late; “Why did we lose?” answered only in postmortems
- Time spent chasing clarity instead of leading with visibility

## Goals & Objectives
- Forecast with confidence using call-backed, signal-based data
- Understand what happened and why across deals, reps, and accounts
- Get high-level insights (briefs, trends, closed/lost) without digging

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **AI CRO** — CRO Executive Briefs; Ask Momentum across pipeline; closed/lost analysis and trend reports; essential clips (objections, discovery) for strategy
- **Deal Execution + Retention + Coaching** — Clean CRM and retention/coaching data feed better pipeline and team visibility
- **Slack/Teams** — “Updates while having my cappuccino” (testimonial); deal and risk alerts routed to the right people
- **Proof** — “Order of magnitude better data”; “decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren’t possible before” (Owner, CRO)

## Buying Process
Typically sponsor or final approver; evaluates with RevOps and sales/CS leadership. Cares about one platform, security (SOC 2, GDPR), and measurable impact on forecast accuracy and rep/CS performance.

## Communication Preferences
Executive outcomes: “forecast with confidence,” “pipeline and team visibility,” “data-driven decisions,” “no more chasing updates.” Proof from CROs and VPs (Owner, 1Password, Demandbase).
