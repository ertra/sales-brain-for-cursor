# Sales Representative (AE)

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Account Executive, Sales Rep, AE. Owns opportunities from lead/meeting to close; collaborates with SDRs, CS, and internal teams.

## Responsibilities
- Run discovery, demos, and negotiations; move deals with accurate next steps and stakeholder coverage
- Keep CRM and pipeline updated so managers and RevOps have visibility
- Hand off to CS with full context; feed Product/Marketing/Enablement with deal and customer signals

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Manual CRM updates and notes after every call; admin cuts into selling time
- Managers and RevOps chase for deal updates; no single place for “what really happened”
- Inconsistent follow-up and prep; next steps or stakeholder intel missing
- Coaching and feedback ad hoc; hard to know what “good” looks like at scale

## Goals & Objectives
- More time with customers; less time on data entry and follow-up emails
- Show up prepared (account brief, recent interactions) and follow up with strong, consistent comms
- Pipeline and forecast reflect reality so no surprise “why is this in commit?” conversations

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Deal Execution Agent** — Notes, CRM fields, cases, and email follow-ups written automatically; prep via Slack DM before each call; well-crafted follow-up emails in seconds
- **Slack deal rooms and alerts** — Key moments, risks, updates routed to manager and AE; “did the buyer bring up budget?” answered from auto-filled Salesforce + transcript
- **Coaching Agent** — Individual feedback after each touchpoint; competency scores and SmartClips for best practices
- **Handoff** — Win recap and context to CS; Product/Marketing/Enablement get signals from calls (objections, feature requests)

## Buying Process
Typically part of team/company rollout; manager or RevOps drives. AEs care about “time back,” “no more bugging for notes,” and “best call summaries they’d seen” (testimonial).

## Communication Preferences
“More time selling,” “notes and follow-ups automated,” “prep before every call,” “pipeline clarity.” Proof: “cut time in half to progress deals in Salesforce” (Ramp); “reps spend time selling” (1Password).
