# Front Line Sales Leader (Sales Manager)

## Company
Momentum

## Role/Title
Front Line Sales Leader, Sales Manager, Director of Sales. Manages AEs and/or SDRs; owns pipeline and forecast for their team.

## Responsibilities
- Pipeline review and deal health; know what’s really happening without chasing reps
- Forecast and pipeline meeting prep with fact-based, call-backed data
- Coach reps consistently; 1:1s and feedback tied to real calls and competencies
- Cross-functional handoffs (to CS, Product, Enablement) with the right context

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- **CRM cop & Slack detective** — Logs into Salesforce, Gong, Slack; DMs reps for updates; pieces together deal truth across tabs; 45–60 min/day lost
- **Gut-based forecast** — Relies on rep opinion and manual Gong checks; “Why is this in commit?” unanswered in QBRs
- **Coaching by memory or Gong archaeology** — Shadowing 1–2 calls; no system for coachable moments; reactive coaching only after pipeline issues
- **Messaging and enablement blindspots** — Reps go off-script; enablement hears objection trends weeks later; no feedback loop from field

## Goals & Objectives
- Lead with visibility instead of chasing clarity; save 45–60 min/day on pipeline review
- Signal-based forecast confidence; MEDDPICC and timeline from actual calls
- AI-driven, rep-specific coaching at scale; scorecards and Slack alerts for missed talk tracks
- Real-time signal routing to Enablement, Product, Marketing so issues get addressed same day

## How Momentum Solves Their Problems
- **Deal Execution + Slack** — Auto-filled Salesforce; Slack alerts for deal health, budget, legal, ghosting; transcript moment + quote in Slack so manager doesn’t search Gong
- **AI CRO** — Forecast summaries; “Deal XYZ → Slipping” with reason (e.g. one stakeholder, budget unclear)
- **Coaching Agent** — Every call scored (talk-to-listen, objection handling, missed steps); weekly scorecards; Slack alerts for missed talk tracks and next steps; SmartClips for best practices
- **Signal routing** — Win recap packets to CS; Product/Marketing/Enablement alerted on trends (objections, feature requests, campaign reactions). Customers: Dealfront, Ramp, Owner, Chowly, 1Password

## Buying Process
Evaluates with RevOps and sometimes Enablement; CRO or VP Sales may sponsor. Cares about time saved, forecast accuracy, coaching at scale, and handoffs. “Time Saved: 45–60 min/day, 1–2 hrs/week on forecast, 30–45 min/rep/week on coaching” (day-in-the-life).

## Communication Preferences
“Stop managing by intuition; start leading with Momentum.” “From CRM cop → to orchestrator.” Proof from sales leaders and RevOps (Ramp, Owner, 1Password).
