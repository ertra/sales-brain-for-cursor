# Coaching Agent → Enablement Value Proposition

## Summary
For Enablement, Momentum’s Coaching Agent means a live feedback loop from the field. Objection trends, messaging effectiveness, and compliance gaps are routed to Enablement in Slack same day—with auto-tagged call clips to update training and battlecards. SmartClips curate best practices with zero manual work; ramp time drops and coaching is tied to what actually wins. From “anecdotal trends weeks later” to structured, scalable enablement feedback.

## The Problem
Enablement hears about objection and messaging trends weeks late. No data on which talk tracks work; “are we explaining the product wrong?” is guesswork. Ramp is inconsistent; no scalable way to replicate top performers. Compliance and process adherence are invisible until audit. Gong stores the footage but no one has time to extract patterns or enforce standards.

## The Solution
Coaching Agent scores every call for messaging adherence, objection handling, and compliance; Slack alerts (“Objection to pricing up 38%,” “Integration confusion in 4/5 calls”) and auto-tagged clips go to Enablement. SmartClips (“Top Openers,” “Best Objection Handling”) provide unlimited learning without manual curation. Compliance dashboards show which reps meet process requirements. Result: same-day response and evidence-based training updates.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Live feedback loop; same day, not weeks
- **Benefit**: Objection, competitor, and compliance signals routed to Enablement in Slack/Teams. Auto-tagged call clips for training and battlecards. “Issues addressed same day, not weeks later.”
- **Proof Point**: “Enablement gets auto-tagged call clips to update training or battlecards.” “From anecdotal trends → structured enablement feedback at scale.” (Sales Leader day-in-the-life)
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning) “Live feedback loop embedded in workflow.”

### 2. Structured feedback at scale (what works, what doesn’t)
- **Benefit**: Every call analyzed for messaging adherence; Slack alerts for trends; which openers and objection handling convert (e.g. “ROI framing” → 27% higher connect). No more guesswork.
- **Proof Point**: “Slack alerts: ‘Objection to pricing up 38% this week,’ ‘Integration confusion detected in 4/5 calls.’” (Sales Leader day)
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning) “From anecdotal trends → structured enablement feedback at scale.”

### 3. SmartClips: zero manual curation, unlimited learning
- **Benefit**: “Top Openers of the Week,” “Best Objection Handling” auto-curated; used in training and self-coaching. Every rep benefits from top 10% best practices; “zero manual curation, unlimited learning.”
- **Proof Point**: “SmartClips auto-curated into ‘Top Openers of the Week’ → SDRs copy proven talk tracks instantly.” “Ramp time cut in half.” (BDR/SDR day)
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning) “Every rep benefits from the top 10%’s best practices.”

### 4. Compliance visibility and process adherence
- **Benefit**: Compliance dashboards show which SDRs/reps meet process requirements; live flags for missing disclaimers or talk tracks. “Every discovery call consistent, compliant, and fully documented.”
- **Proof Point**: “Slack alert: ‘Compliance statement not delivered — follow up required.’” “Compliance dashboards show which SDRs consistently meet process requirements.” (BDR/SDR day)
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning) “Consistent, compliant, documented.”

### 5. Ramp and replication of top performers
- **Benefit**: Coaching scorecards and SmartClips tie enablement to outcomes; ramp time cut; “some SDRs hit quota quickly, others stall” becomes “every rep benefits from best practices.”
- **Proof Point**: “Ramp time cut in half.” Owner, Ramp use for “real-time, in-stream rep development.” (Sales Leader day)
- **Customer Quote**: “Momentum substantially increases the probability of reps doing the right things.” — Steve Dinner, Owner
