# Deal Execution Agent → Sales Value Proposition

## Summary
For sales reps and managers, Momentum’s Deal Execution Agent means more time selling and less time on admin. Notes, CRM fields, and follow-ups are written automatically; prep lands in Slack before every call. Pipeline and deal truth are in one place so managers lead with visibility instead of chasing updates. Result: cut time to progress deals in half and keep pipeline accurate.

## The Problem
Reps spend hours on call notes, CRM updates, and follow-up emails. Managers act as “CRM cop and Slack detective”—45–60 min/day assembling deal context from Salesforce, Gong, and Slack. SDR handoffs are weak; pipeline hygiene varies wildly; forecast and coaching lack a single source of truth.

## The Solution
Deal Execution Agent automates post-call admin: AI notes and field extraction write to Salesforce (and Snowflake) on every call; prep and follow-up emails are delivered in Slack. MEDDIC Autopilot keeps required fields populated. Managers get alerts (deal health, budget, next steps) and transcript moments in Slack so they don’t search Gong. Handoff briefs give AEs full context so meetings convert.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. More time selling; less admin
- **Benefit**: Reps and CSMs focus on revenue-generating activities; notes, CRM fields, cases, and follow-ups written on their behalf.
- **Proof Point**: “Cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce.” — Ramp, Head of GTM Systems
- **Customer Quote**: “The most important thing Momentum delivers for me is insight at scale. Reps aren’t spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They’re spending their time selling.” — Navin Persaud, VP RevOps, 1Password

### 2. Pipeline and deal visibility without chasing
- **Benefit**: Auto-filled Salesforce; Slack alerts for deal health, ghosting, budget, next steps; transcript moment + quote in Slack. Manager stops searching Gong.
- **Proof Point**: “Time saved: 45–60 min/day. Strategic shift: from chasing clarity → to leading with visibility.” (Front Line Sales Leader day-in-the-life)
- **Customer Quote**: “Momentum is like a sales manager that stays up 24/7 and listens to every call, notifying the right folks when they should be paying attention to a deal.” — Nathan Follen, Ramp

### 3. Consistent, compliant handoffs (SDR→AE)
- **Benefit**: Handoff brief auto-generated at meeting booked: goals, challenges, objections, qualification, SmartClips. Brief in AE’s Slack + Salesforce—zero info lost.
- **Proof Point**: “AEs show up informed, meetings convert, and trust between SDRs and AEs skyrockets.” (BDR/SDR day-in-the-life)
- **Customer Quote**: “Our reps immediately fell in love with it. They said the call summaries were the best they’d seen.” — João Dias, Senior Manager RevOps, YipitData

### 4. CRM as single source of truth
- **Benefit**: 100% required fields populated; multi-object writeback (Opportunity, Account, Contact, Event); audit-ready summaries. No more bugging reps to update opportunities.
- **Proof Point**: 80% CRM data increase (site); “CRM becomes a single source of truth, without slowing SDRs down.”
- **Customer Quote**: “With Momentum, progressing deals is faster and more streamlined. Our team has clarity.” — Nate Follen, Ramp
