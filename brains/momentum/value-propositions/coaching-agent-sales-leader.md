# Coaching Agent → Sales Leader Value Proposition

## Summary
For front-line sales leaders, Momentum’s Coaching Agent means data-backed coaching at scale. Every call is scored; scorecards and SmartClips surface what’s working and what to fix. Managers get Slack alerts for missed talk tracks and next steps so 1:1s are evidence-based—and save 30–45 min/rep/week. From “coaching by memory or Gong archaeology” to systemized, scalable coaching that cuts ramp time and replicates top performers.

## The Problem
Managers prep 1:1s by digging through Gong and listening to 2–3 calls per rep; coaching is ad hoc and reactive. No system for coachable moments; SDRs rarely hear what “good” sounds like; ramp is inconsistent. Messaging and compliance blindspots surface weeks later; enablement has no live feedback from the field.

## The Solution
Coaching Agent evaluates every call (discovery, objection handling, talk-to-listen, compliance); generates weekly scorecards and Slack alerts for missed steps and talk tracks. SmartClips auto-curate “Best Objection Handling,” “Top Openers” for training and self-coaching. Coaching data feeds Salesforce; RETRO & AUTO Pilot scale from real-time alerts to historical analysis. Signal routing sends objection and messaging trends to Enablement same day.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. AI-driven, rep-specific coaching at scale
- **Benefit**: Every call scored; no sample bias. Weekly scorecards by rep; Slack alerts (“Rep missed 5% service fee talk track,” “No clear next step after demo”). 30–45 min/rep/week saved on coaching prep.
- **Proof Point**: “From scattered feedback → to systemized, data-backed coaching.” “Time saved: 30–45 min/rep/week.” (Front Line Sales Leader day-in-the-life)
- **Customer Quote**: “It’s like having a sales manager that works 24/7, providing insights we never thought possible.” — Steve Dinner, VP RevOps, Owner

### 2. SmartClips: best practices without manual curation
- **Benefit**: Auto-generated video highlights (“Top Openers of the Week,” “Best Objection Handling”); zero manual curation; every rep benefits from top 10% behaviors. Instant delivery in Slack/Teams.
- **Proof Point**: “Every SDR call scored on opener effectiveness, qualification, compliance, objection handling. SmartClips auto-curated for training & self-coaching. Ramp time cut in half.” (BDR/SDR day)
- **Customer Quote**: “Every time I show a sales manager the Momentum call summaries, I get one of 3 responses: awesome, amazing, or love it! It’s been years since I’ve heard sales managers get this excited about a tool.” — Alek Milovidov, Sr. Director RevOps, Alation

### 3. Live feedback loop to enablement
- **Benefit**: Objection trends, messaging adherence, compliance gaps routed to Enablement in Slack; “enablement gets auto-tagged call clips to update training or battlecards.” Same-day response instead of weeks later.
- **Proof Point**: “Slack alerts: ‘Objection to pricing up 38% this week,’ ‘Integration confusion detected in 4/5 calls.’ From anecdotal trends → structured enablement feedback at scale.” (Sales Leader day)
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning) “Live feedback loop embedded in workflow.”

### 4. Coaching scores in your systems
- **Benefit**: Coaching performance feeds into Salesforce (and other CRMs); rep scorecards, dashboards, compensation logic enriched with structured AI feedback. Deep Teams and Outlook integration.
- **Proof Point**: “Coaching performance feeds directly into Salesforce, enriching rep scorecards, dashboards, and compensation logic.” (Coaching Agent page)
- **Customer Quote**: “Momentum substantially increases the probability of reps doing the right things. It’s the #1 thing I mention to friends in RevOps—‘Let me show you something that will change your world.’” — Steve Dinner, Owner
