# Deal Execution Agent → RevOps Value Proposition

## Summary
For RevOps, Momentum’s Deal Execution Agent means a sparkling-clean CRM without bugging reps. Automated call notes and field extraction populate Salesforce (and Snowflake) on every call; forecast and quota setting use accurate, call-backed data. Fits into existing process with Salesforce, Slack, and your stack—hassle-free set-up and flexibility when workflow changes.

## The Problem
Reps don’t update CRM; data hygiene and pipeline accuracy suffer. RevOps spends time chasing updates and running guesswork on forecasting and quotas. Every new tool adds training and change management; process changes make tools the bottleneck.

## The Solution
Deal Execution Agent automates notes and field extraction; MEDDIC Autopilot keeps required fields populated. RevOps stops bugging reps and focuses on strategy. AI CRO and Retention Agent feed accurate account and deal data (including churn risk) into forecast. Integrations fit into process; “Momentum is the least of my worries when we make workflow changes.”
