# Customer Retention Agent → Customer Success Value Proposition

## Summary
For Customer Success, Momentum’s Customer Retention Agent means flagging churn risk in real time and capturing notes and cases automatically. Sentiment from calls, support tickets, and emails flows into one view; sales-to-CS handoff is smooth with Account Rooms and better CRM data. Result: save critical accounts and give CSMs time back for customers.

## The Problem
Churn and risk are discovered too late. CSMs spend time on manual notes and case creation. Handoff from sales is incomplete; CS rediscovers the account. No single view of sentiment across touchpoints; leadership visibility is reactive.

## The Solution
Customer Retention Agent detects churn risk from interactions and sends instant Slack notifications; automatically writes and saves Customer Cases to Salesforce and syncs with workflow. Deal Execution and Account Rooms ensure smooth sales-to-CS handoff. AI CRO alerts leadership for impactful customers (churn risk, competitor mentions, sentiment).
