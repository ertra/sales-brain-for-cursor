# Deal Execution Agent

## Company
Momentum

## Overview
AI agent that automates post-call admin and improves data hygiene: updates Salesforce fields, saves notes, and sends email follow-ups so reps and CSMs can focus on selling and customer relationships. Part of Momentum’s AI Revenue Orchestration Platform.

## Main Features
- **CRM field extraction on autopilot** — Write to any field or object in Salesforce or push data to Snowflake per call or per account; positions 100% improvements in data hygiene and data-driven decisions.
- **Accurate AI notes in Salesforce** — Notes, CRM fields, Salesforce cases, and email follow-ups written automatically on behalf of Sales and CS.
- **Prep and follow-up** — Relevant account details delivered via Slack DM before each call; well-crafted follow-up emails generated in seconds.
- Integrates with MEDDPIC Autopilot, AI Summaries, Approvals, and existing tools (Slack, Salesforce, Snowflake).

## Problem Solved
Reps and CSMs spend hours on manual CRM updates, note-taking, and follow-up emails. Deal Execution Agent removes that admin so they spend more time with customers and moving deals.

## Value Proposition
Accelerate deals and eliminate admin. Sales and CS focus on revenue-generating activities; Momentum keeps Salesforce accurate and ensures great follow-up every time. Customers (e.g. Ramp) report cutting time to progress deals in Salesforce in half.

## Target Customers
Sales reps, CSMs, RevOps, front-line sales leaders. Teams already using Salesforce (and Slack) who want better data hygiene and less manual data entry.
