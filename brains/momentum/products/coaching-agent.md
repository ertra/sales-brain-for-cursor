# AI Sales Coaching Agent

## Company
Momentum

## Overview
AI Sales Coaching Agent that unlocks team potential with automated, full-coverage call analysis, real-time feedback, and scalable coaching including SmartClips (video highlights). Every call is evaluated for discovery, objection handling, product positioning, and more.

## Main Features
- **Objective, full-coverage coaching** — Every call evaluated; analysis across discovery, objection handling, product positioning; fairness, scale, and consistency.
- **Customizable, role-aligned competencies** — Design and track metrics aligned to your methodology (discovery, closing, enterprise value, multi-stakeholder orchestration); tuned via CRM logic so triggers run only on relevant calls.
- **Dashboards and insights** — Individual and team performance dashboards; aggregate coaching trends; spider charts and trend lines for strengths and gaps across reps and cohorts.
- **SmartClips** — Auto-generated video highlights; instant multi-channel delivery (e.g. Slack, Teams); zero manual curation, unlimited learning.
- **CRM integration** — Coaching scores feed into Salesforce (and other CRMs) for scorecards, dashboards, and compensation logic. RETRO & AUTO Pilot enabled; deep Microsoft Teams and Outlook integration.

## Problem Solved
Coaching is often inconsistent, sample-based, and manual. Managers can’t scale feedback. Coaching Agent gives always-on, evidence-based feedback after every touchpoint so reps improve consistently.

## Value Proposition
Always-on coaching that scales. No guesswork, no bottlenecks—continuous, evidence-based coaching that accelerates results. Sales managers get visibility into coaching needs by region, cohort, or time frame to target interventions and reduce ramp time.

## Target Customers
Front-line sales leaders, RevOps, enablement, sales reps. Revenue teams that want consistent, scalable coaching and coaching data in the CRM.
