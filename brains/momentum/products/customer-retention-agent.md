# Customer Retention Agent

## Main Features
- **Automatically write and save Customer Cases to Salesforce** — Capture CS notes and cases, log in Salesforce, sync with workflows; saves time and improves data accuracy.

## Problem Solved
CS teams often learn about churn too late and spend time chasing updates. Hidden feedback in calls and tickets doesn’t get structured or routed. Retention Agent surfaces risk and feedback early and automates case/note creation.

## Value Proposition

## Target Customers
Customer Success leaders and managers, RevOps, CROs. Organizations that care about retention, expansion, and smooth sales-to-CS handoff.
