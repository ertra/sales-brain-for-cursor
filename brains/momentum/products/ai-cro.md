# AI CRO (Executive Insights)

## Company
Momentum

## Overview
AI-powered executive insights for CROs and revenue leadership: visibility into pipeline, reps, and accounts in real time. Analyze trends, detect risks, and make data-driven decisions with CRO briefs, Ask Momentum, and closed/lost analysis.

## Main Features
- **CRO Executive Briefs** — High-level, AI-powered insights on pipeline performance, rep activity, and account health for faster, data-driven decisions.
- **Ask Momentum across the pipeline** — On-demand AI-driven insights on deals, reps, and accounts to uncover trends, identify risks, and drive smarter revenue decisions (factual and opinion-style, e.g. how a pitch landed).
- **Closed/Lost analysis & trend reports** — Uncover patterns behind lost deals with AI-driven analysis and trend reports to refine strategy and improve win rates.
- **Essential Clips (coming soon)** — Key video moments from calls (objections, discovery, critical conversations) to refine strategy and close more deals.

## Problem Solved
Executives lack a single, real-time view of pipeline and team performance. Insights are scattered across CRM, calls, and emails. AI CRO centralizes and surfaces what happened and why so leadership can act quickly.

## Value Proposition
Gain deep revenue and team insights with AI CRO. Understand pipeline, reps, and accounts in real time; reduce guesswork in forecasting and quotas with accurate account and deal data including churn risk. Customers (e.g. 1Password, Owner) cite insight at scale and better data for decisions.

## Target Customers
CROs, VP Sales, VP RevOps, revenue leadership. Week-in-the-life use case for Chief Revenue Officer; also relevant for sales and CS leaders who need pipeline and team visibility.
