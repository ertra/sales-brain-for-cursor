# Revenue Leader (CRO) - Pain Points

## Overview
CROs and revenue leadership lack a single source of truth for pipeline, reps, and accounts; rely on manual synthesis and gut for forecast and strategy; and discover deal risk and churn too late. They spend time chasing updates instead of leading with visibility. Momentum addresses these with AI CRO, Deal Execution, Customer Retention, and Coaching Agents plus Slack/Teams routing.

## Pain Points

### 1. Scattered sources of truth; no single place for pipeline and team performance
- **Description**: Pipeline and team insights live in CRM, Gong, Slack, spreadsheets. “No single place”; CRO and leadership chase updates from multiple systems. “I don’t know how I would update key stakeholders without Momentum other than through a whole lot of emails, disjointed Slack messages.”
- **Impact**: Decisions delayed or based on incomplete data; strategic time lost on assembling context; board and forecast reviews reactive.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual rollups, recurring meetings to gather context, or acceptance of fragmented view.
- **Frequency**: Daily / Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO (CRO Executive Briefs; Ask Momentum across pipeline); Slack/Teams as command center; deal rooms and alerts route key moments to the right people.
- **Key Message**: “Looking at Momentum updates while having my cappuccino in the morning provides me and other stakeholders all the visibility and updates we need without having to ask for it.”

### 2. Forecast and pipeline reviews rely on gut and manual archaeology
- **Description**: Forecast built from rep opinion and best guesses; “why is this in commit?” unanswered. Cross-checking Gong or CRM is manual; “CI tools give access but not action.” No call-backed, signal-based view of pipeline.
- **Impact**: Forecast surprises; last-minute scrambles; leadership lacks confidence in the number.
- **Current Solutions**: Custom briefs, manual Gong/CRM checks, or acceptance of gut-based forecast.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO (signal-based forecast; MEDDPICC and timeline from calls); Slack summaries (“Deal XYZ → Slipping” with reason); pipeline and team analysis.
- **Key Message**: “Order of magnitude better data than we’ve ever had before. We’re making decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren’t possible before.”

### 3. Churn and deal risk surface too late
- **Description**: “Why did we lose?” answered only in postmortems. At-risk accounts and lost-deal patterns discovered after the fact. No proactive alerts for churn risk, competitor mentions, or sentiment.
- **Impact**: Reactive firefighting; missed save and intervention opportunities; strategy and roadmap informed too late.
- **Current Solutions**: Win/loss reviews, manual analysis, or acceptance of lagging intelligence.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / quarterly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO (closed/lost analysis and trend reports); Customer Retention Agent (churn risk, sentiment alerts); “uncover patterns behind lost deals.”
- **Key Message**: “Uncover patterns behind lost deals with AI-driven analysis and trend reports. Get notified immediately of churn risk.”

### 4. Time spent chasing clarity instead of leading with visibility
- **Description**: Leadership and managers act as “pipeline detective”; 45–60 min/day assembling deal truth. “Despite having Gong, there’s still no centralized, real-time signal.”
- **Impact**: Strategic time lost; decisions delayed; team feels the pull of “update the spreadsheet” culture.
- **Current Solutions**: More meetings, more reports, or acceptance of lag.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Auto-filled Salesforce; Slack alerts (deal health, risk, next steps); transcript moment + quote in Slack; “from chasing clarity → to leading with visibility.”
- **Key Message**: “Strategic shift: from chasing clarity → to leading with visibility. Time saved: 45–60 min/day for managers.”

### 5. Insight at scale for reps and team performance
- **Description**: Hard to know how reps and teams are really performing without listening to every call or digging through tools. “The most important thing Momentum delivers for me is insight at scale. Reps aren’t spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They’re spending their time selling.”
- **Impact**: Inconsistent execution; coaching and capacity decisions not data-driven.
- **Current Solutions**: Sample-based reviews, manager judgment, or acceptance of limited visibility.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO (team analysis, CRO briefs); Coaching Agent (scorecards, SmartClips); Deal Execution (data feeds pipeline and rep visibility).
- **Key Message**: “Insight at scale. Understand your pipeline, reps, and accounts in real time.”

## Discovery Questions
1. Where do you get “the truth” about pipeline and team performance today — and how much time do you or your team spend assembling it?
2. How do you build forecast and prepare for board or pipeline reviews — and how much is based on actual call/account data?
3. When do you typically learn about at-risk accounts or lost deals — and what would you need to see it earlier?
4. How do you balance “insight at scale” with keeping reps focused on selling (not admin)?

## Trigger Events
- Forecast miss or board pressure; “we need better visibility”
- New CRO or revenue leadership; one source of truth initiative
- Churn or win-rate concern; “why did we lose?” asked repeatedly
- Scaling GTM; need to lead without proportionally scaling meetings
