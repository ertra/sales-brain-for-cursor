# Revenue Operations - Pain Points

## Overview
RevOps teams struggle with CRM data quality, rep adoption of data entry, forecast accuracy, and tool sprawl. They spend time bugging reps to update opportunities, run guesswork on forecasting and quotas, and need solutions that fit existing process without yet another training burden. Momentum addresses these with Deal Execution Agent, Customer Retention Agent, AI CRO, and integrations.

## Pain Points

### 1. Reps don’t update CRM; data hygiene and pipeline accuracy suffer
- **Description**: RevOps can’t get consistent, complete data from reps and CSMs. Required fields (budget, champion, next steps) left blank; pipeline and reporting unreliable. “CRM hygiene varies wildly”; managers and AEs don’t trust the data.
- **Impact**: Forecast and quota setting based on guesswork; pipeline inflated or inaccurate; audit and compliance risk; strategic work deprioritized for data chasing.
- **Current Solutions**: Reminders, spot checks, dashboards that show gaps but don’t fix them, or acceptance of poor hygiene.
- **Frequency**: Daily / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Deal Execution Agent (automated call notes, field extraction, multi-object writeback); MEDDIC Autopilot; 100% required fields populated (site claim); “RevOps doesn’t need to bug reps.”
- **Key Message**: “Keep your CRM sparkling clean. Automated call notes so you focus on strategic work, not chasing updates.”

### 2. Guesswork in forecasting and quota setting
- **Description**: Forecasting and setting quotas without accurate account and deal data. Churn risk and deal health not in the system; “why is this in commit?” unanswered. Reliance on rep opinion and manual cross-checks.
- **Impact**: Forecast misses; quota misalignment; leadership lacks confidence in pipeline and team data.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual Gong/CRM reviews, custom reports, or acceptance of gut-based forecast.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO; accurate account and deal data from calls (MEDDPICC, timeline, churn risk); signal-based forecast; Slack summaries for deal and forecast risk.
- **Key Message**: “Decrease the guesswork in forecasting and setting quotas with accurate account and deal data, including churn risk.”

### 3. Yet another tool to train on; change management fatigue
- **Description**: Every new tool requires training and change management. Teams resist “one more thing”; adoption and flexibility become concerns. “When we make workflow changes, I need peace of mind.”
- **Impact**: Slow rollout; underuse; RevOps spends time on support and process instead of strategy.
- **Current Solutions**: Heavy training, phased rollout, or avoiding new tools despite need.
- **Frequency**: At implementation / change
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Integrations with Salesforce, Slack, Snowflake and existing stack; “fits into your process”; “Momentum isn’t another tool to train on”; “flexibility to fit our needs” (testimonial).
- **Key Message**: “Hassle-free set-up. It fits into your process by integrating with the tools your team already uses.”

### 4. Need for flexibility when workflow and process change
- **Description**: Process and workflow evolve; RevOps needs tools that adapt without becoming the bottleneck. “When we make workflow changes, Momentum is the least of my worries.”
- **Impact**: Rigid tools block process improvement; RevOps stuck maintaining workarounds.
- **Current Solutions**: Custom config, multiple tools, or living with constraints.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / at change
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: Platform flexibility; workflow recipes; “yet to stump them with a crazy RevOps request” (Fleet); configurable automations.
- **Key Message**: “Plus it has the flexibility to fit our needs. Peace of mind when we make workflow changes.”

### 5. Churn and retention data not in the system
- **Description**: Churn risk and customer sentiment live in calls and tickets, not in CRM or workflows. RevOps and CS can’t forecast retention or act early without manual synthesis.
- **Impact**: Renewal and expansion forecasts unreliable; reactive firefighting; missed save opportunities.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual review of support/call data, or acceptance of lagging indicators.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Customer Retention Agent (churn risk signals, sentiment, cases in Salesforce); data feeds forecasting and workflow.
- **Key Message**: “Accurate account and deal data, including churn risk. Flag at-risk accounts sooner than ever.”

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time does RevOps spend chasing reps for CRM updates and pipeline context?
2. How do you build forecast and set quotas today — and how much is based on actual call/account data vs. rep input?
3. How do you handle new tool rollout and change management, and what would “fits into our process” mean for your team?
4. Where does churn and retention risk live today, and when do you typically act on it?

## Trigger Events
- New RevOps or GTM systems lead; “we need better data hygiene”
- Forecast miss or pipeline audit; board pressure on accuracy
- Tool consolidation or “one source of truth” initiative
- Scaling team; need to maintain process without scaling admin
