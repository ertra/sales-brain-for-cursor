# Marketing - Pain Points

## Overview
Marketing leaders lack systematic insight into what messaging and campaigns resonate, which competitors show up in conversations, and who the happiest customers are for case studies. Data is trapped in calls and discovered in postmortems. Momentum addresses these with Deep Research, Ask Momentum, signal routing to Marketing, and case study candidate alerts.

## Pain Points

### 1. Market and competitive insights trapped in calls
- **Description**: “There’s a ton of data hidden in customer engagements.” Which competitors pop up, how messaging lands, and what buyers care about live in calls and emails—not in a format marketing can use. Postmortems and win/loss come too late for campaign or positioning decisions.
- **Impact**: Messaging and campaigns not informed by real conversations; competitive and positioning gaps discovered late.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual win/loss, one-off interviews, or acceptance of lagging intelligence.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Deep Research / Ask Momentum (insights from engagements: competitors, messaging effectiveness); “on-demand insights from a call or account” (e.g. how a pitch landed); signal routing when buyers react to campaign messaging.
- **Key Message**: “Momentum dives into customer engagements to pull out insights like which competitors are popping up and messaging effectiveness. Market research on autopilot.”

### 2. No systematic way to find case study and reference candidates
- **Description**: Finding “happiest customers” for case studies and references is manual—asking sales and CS, scanning NPS, or hoping for volunteers. No automated view of positive sentiment and quotes from calls.
- **Impact**: Slow case study pipeline; missed reference opportunities; marketing and sales ask the same customers repeatedly.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual outreach, NPS mining, or ad hoc requests.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: “Receive automated alerts in Slack with quotes and recordings from your happiest customers to create your case study candidate list.”
- **Key Message**: “Receive automated alerts with quotes and recordings from your happiest customers to create your case study candidate list.”

### 3. Disconnect between campaign messaging and what lands in conversations
- **Description**: Marketing doesn’t know how campaign messaging lands until late or anecdotally. “Are we explaining the product wrong?” No feedback loop from field to marketing when buyers react to campaigns or messaging.
- **Impact**: Wasted spend; messaging and creative not optimized; alignment with sales and product weak.
- **Current Solutions**: Surveys, spot checks, or acceptance of guesswork.
- **Frequency**: Per campaign / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Signal routing—“Marketing alerted when buyers react to campaign messaging”; Ask Momentum (e.g. how a pitch landed); “democratize insights to the whole organization.”
- **Key Message**: “Create alerts for impactful customers. Keep the C-suite updated. Ensure the entire organization has insights from your go-to-market motion.”

### 4. Slow or manual feedback loop from sales to marketing
- **Description**: Product, CS, Enablement, and Marketing “all waiting for signals trapped in calls.” Routing is manual, error-prone, or missed. “Gong holds the insights, but routing them is manual.”
- **Impact**: Marketing reacts late; competitive and messaging intelligence delayed; campaigns and content not data-driven.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual handoffs, recurring meetings, or hope that someone shares.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Real-time signal routing to Marketing in Slack/Teams (objection trends, competitor mentions, campaign reactions); “democratized GTM data.”
- **Key Message**: “Right message to the right person at the right time. Alerts routed to Sales, CS, Leadership, Marketing—everyone gets what they need without asking.”

### 5. Win/loss and “why we’re winning and losing” not systematic
- **Description**: Understanding why deals are won or lost for positioning and messaging is ad hoc. “Uncover patterns behind lost deals” and “understand why you’re winning and losing deals” are goals but not operationalized from conversation data.
- **Impact**: Positioning and messaging not informed by win/loss patterns; product and marketing roadmap gaps.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual win/loss reviews, spreadsheets, or acceptance of anecdotes.
- **Frequency**: Quarterly / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO (closed/lost analysis and trend reports); “uncover patterns behind lost deals with AI-driven analysis and trend reports to inform the product roadmap”; Ask Momentum across pipeline.
- **Key Message**: “Uncover patterns behind lost deals. Understand why you’re winning and losing deals.”

|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Insights trapped in calls | High | Ongoing | Deep Research, Ask Momentum, signals | Market research on autopilot; competitors and messaging |
| Case study candidates | Medium–High | Ongoing | Automated alerts (quotes, recordings) | Case study candidate list from happiest customers |

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you today learn what messaging and campaigns resonate in actual sales conversations?
2. How do you find and prioritize customers for case studies and references?
3. When do you get feedback that buyers are reacting to campaign messaging — and what would you need to act same day?
4. How do you run win/loss and use it for positioning and messaging — and how much is from conversation data?

## Trigger Events
- New CMO or demand gen lead; “we need messaging intelligence”
- Case study or reference program push; need a pipeline of happy customers
- Competitive or positioning shift; need real conversation data
- Campaign performance review; need to tie results to what’s said in deals
