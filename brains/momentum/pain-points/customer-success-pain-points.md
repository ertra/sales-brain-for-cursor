# Customer Success - Pain Points

## Overview
Customer Success teams discover churn and risk too late, spend time on manual notes and cases, and struggle with incomplete handoffs from sales. They lack real-time sentiment and a single view of customer health across touchpoints. Momentum addresses these with Customer Retention Agent, Deal Execution Agent, and Slack/Account Rooms.

## Pain Points

### 1. Churn and risk discovered too late
- **Description**: At-risk accounts and dissatisfaction surface at renewal or in postmortems. No real-time view of sentiment from calls, support tickets, and emails; “learning about risk too late.”
- **Impact**: Reactive save attempts; lost renewals and expansion; C-suite and forecast surprised by churn.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual health scores, support ticket review, or acceptance of lagging indicators.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / at renewal
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Customer Retention Agent (churn risk signals from interactions; instant Slack notifications); sentiment analysis across calls, tickets, emails; “flag churn risk in real time.”
- **Key Message**: “Momentum flags risks in real time, enabling us to save critical accounts. Get notified immediately of any churn risk.”

### 2. Manual notes and case creation; admin takes time from customers
- **Description**: CSMs manually capture notes and cases after every call; data often incomplete or delayed. CRM and workflow out of sync; “admin takes time from customers.”
- **Impact**: Less time on customer relationships; inconsistent data for forecasting and handoffs; managers and RevOps can’t trust health or next steps.
- **Current Solutions**: Templates, discipline, or acceptance of backlog and gaps.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Customer Retention Agent (automatically write and save Customer Cases to Salesforce; sync with workflow); Deal Execution Agent (AI notes, field updates).
- **Key Message**: “Automatically capture customer success notes and cases, log them in Salesforce, and sync with your workflow. Capture accurate data and give your team time back.”

### 3. Sales-to-CS handoff incomplete; CS rediscovers account
- **Description**: Handoff from sales is often a one-liner or scattered in Slack. CS rediscovers goals, stakeholders, and context; customer experience suffers; “smooth handoff” is the exception.
- **Impact**: Duplicate discovery; slower time-to-value; risk and opportunity missed in transition.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual briefs, kickoff calls, or hope that CS finds context in CRM.
- **Frequency**: Per deal / at close
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Account Rooms and better CRM data; auto-generated win recap packets to CS (decision maker, close reason, product concerns); “streamline the sales to Customer Success handoff.”
- **Key Message**: “With Account Rooms and better CRM data, the sales to CS handoff is smooth, making the customer experience seamless.”

### 4. No single view of sentiment across touchpoints
- **Description**: Sentiment and feedback scattered across calls, support tickets, emails. No holistic view of customer sentiment; “disjointed view of customer health.”
- **Impact**: Inconsistent response; missed patterns; renewal and expansion decisions based on incomplete picture.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual synthesis, spot checks, or siloed tools per channel.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Customer Retention Agent (signals from calls, tickets, emails); “receive insights from customer calls, support tickets, emails, and more to get a holistic view of customer sentiment.”
- **Key Message**: “Receive insights from every touchpoint for a holistic view of customer sentiment.”

### 5. C-suite and leadership visibility reactive, not proactive
- **Description**: Leadership learns about churn risk and impactful customers only when escalated or at review. No proactive alerts for churn risk, competitor mentions, or overall sentiment.
- **Impact**: Surprises at board or QBR; delayed action on at-risk accounts.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual reports, dashboards, or escalation only when CS raises flag.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO; alerts for impactful customers (churn risk, competitor mentions, sentiment); “keep the C-suite updated.”
- **Key Message**: “Create alerts for impactful customers with churn risk, competitor mentions, or overall customer sentiment. Keep the C-suite updated.”

## Discovery Questions
1. When do you typically find out an account is at risk — and what would you need to see it earlier?
2. How much time do CSMs spend on notes and case creation vs. customer-facing work?
3. How complete is the handoff from sales to CS today, and where does CS get account context?
4. Where does customer sentiment live today — and how do you combine calls, support, and email?

## Trigger Events
- Churn spike or renewal miss; “we need to see risk earlier”
- New CS leader or scale-up; need to standardize handoff and data
- Board or CRO asking for retention and health visibility
- Sales and CS alignment initiative
