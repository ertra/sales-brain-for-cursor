# Enablement - Pain Points

## Overview
Enablement teams hear about objection trends, messaging misfires, and compliance gaps weeks late; lack a live feedback loop from the field; and struggle to scale coaching and training with evidence. They rely on anecdotes and manual clip curation. Momentum addresses these with Coaching Agent, SmartClips, and real-time signal routing to Enablement.

## Pain Points

### 1. Enablement hears about objection and messaging trends weeks later
- **Description**: No real-time feedback from field to enablement. “Objection to pricing up 38%” or “integration confusion in 4/5 calls” discovered in postmortems or one-off Slack messages. “Enablement hears about objection trends weeks later.”
- **Impact**: Training and battlecards outdated; reps repeat same mistakes; messaging and competitive response lag.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual listening, surveys, or acceptance of lag.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Real-time signal routing; Slack alerts (e.g. “Objection to pricing up 38% this week,” “Integration confusion detected in 4/5 calls”); “enablement gets auto-tagged call clips to update training or battlecards.”
- **Key Message**: “Live feedback loop embedded in workflow. Issues addressed same day, not weeks later.”

### 2. Messaging and compliance blindspots; no data on what works
- **Description**: Reps go off-script; required talk tracks skipped. “Are we explaining the product wrong?” is guesswork. “Gong stores the footage, but no one has time to extract patterns or enforce standards.” No objective view of which openers or objection handling convert.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent execution; compliance risk; enablement can’t prove impact or target interventions.
- **Current Solutions**: Shadowing, spot checks, or acceptance of variability.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Coaching Agent (every call scored for messaging adherence, objection handling, compliance); SmartClips (“Best Objection Handling,” “Top Openers of the Week”); dashboards and Slack alerts for missed talk tracks.
- **Key Message**: “From anecdotal trends → structured enablement feedback at scale. Auto-tagged clips for training and battlecards.”

### 3. Ramp inconsistent; limited view of what top performers do
- **Description**: “Some SDRs hit quota quickly, others stall.” Managers shadow 1–2 calls; “SDRs rarely hear what ‘good’ sounds like.” No scalable way to replicate top performer behaviors or curate best-practice clips.
- **Impact**: Long ramp; uneven performance; enablement and coaching not tied to what actually wins.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual coaching, best-effort curation, or acceptance of variance.
- **Frequency**: Per hire / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Coaching Agent (every call scored; competency dashboards); SmartClips auto-curated (“Top Openers,” “Best Objection Handling”) for training and self-coaching; “ramp time cut in half” (BDR/SDR day-in-the-life).
- **Key Message**: “Every rep benefits from the top 10%’s best practices. Zero manual curation, unlimited learning.”

### 4. No system for coachable moments; reactive coaching only
- **Description**: “No system for tracking coachable moments”; “reactive coaching only after pipeline issues.” Managers prep 1:1s by digging through Gong; coaching is ad hoc and not tied to consistent criteria.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent feedback; managers spend time hunting signals instead of improving performance; “30–45 min/rep/week” on coaching prep (sales leader day).
- **Current Solutions**: Manager memory, Gong archaeology, or acceptance of ad hoc coaching.
- **Frequency**: Weekly (1:1s)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Coaching Agent (scorecards, Slack alerts for missed steps and talk tracks); “AI-driven, rep-specific coaching at scale”; RETRO & AUTO Pilot; coaching data in Salesforce.
- **Key Message**: “From scattered feedback → systemized, data-backed coaching. Time saved: 30–45 min/rep/week.”

### 5. Compliance and process adherence invisible until audit
- **Description**: Compliance failures (disclaimers, opt-in, required talk tracks) discovered retroactively. No dashboard or alert for which reps or calls meet process requirements; “compliance slips” on discovery calls.
- **Impact**: Audit and regulatory risk; inconsistent customer experience; enablement can’t target compliance training.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual review, sampling, or hope.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / at audit
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Live compliance signals; Autopilot updates; “Slack alert: Compliance statement not delivered — follow up required”; compliance dashboards (BDR/SDR day).
- **Key Message**: “Every discovery call consistent, compliant, and fully documented. Compliance dashboards show which SDRs meet process requirements.”

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Key Message |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Trends heard weeks later | High | Ongoing | Signal routing, auto-tagged clips | Same day, not weeks; live feedback loop |
| Messaging/compliance blindspots | High | Ongoing | Coaching Agent, SmartClips | Structured feedback at scale; what works |
| Ramp inconsistent | High | Per hire | Coaching, SmartClips | Top 10% best practices; ramp cut in half |
| No system for coachable moments | High | Weekly | Coaching Agent, scorecards | Data-backed coaching; 30–45 min/rep saved |
| Compliance invisible until audit | Medium–High | Ongoing | Compliance signals, dashboards | Consistent, compliant, documented |

## Discovery Questions
1. When do you typically learn about objection or messaging trends — and how do you update training and battlecards?
2. How do you know what top performers do differently, and how do you get that to the rest of the team?
3. How much time do managers spend prepping for coaching and 1:1s — and where does the data come from?
4. How do you monitor compliance and process adherence today — and when do you find gaps?

## Trigger Events
- Ramp time or win rate under pressure; “we need to scale coaching”
- New enablement lead; “we need a feedback loop from the field”
- Compliance or audit concern; need to prove adherence
- Messaging or competitive shift; need to update training fast
