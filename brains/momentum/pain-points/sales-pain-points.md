# Sales - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales teams (SDRs, AEs, sales managers) are buried in manual CRM updates, notes, and follow-up; lack real-time pipeline and deal visibility; and struggle to coach at scale. They act as “CRM cop and Slack detective,” rely on gut and Gong archaeology for forecast, and discover deal risk and handoff gaps too late. Momentum addresses these with Deal Execution Agent, Coaching Agent, and AI CRO.

## Pain Points

### 1. Manual admin and CRM hygiene (notes, fields, follow-ups)
- **Description**: Reps and CSMs spend hours on call notes, CRM updates, and follow-up emails instead of selling. SDRs manually type notes; budget and key fields left blank; managers and AEs don’t trust pipeline. “CRM hygiene varies wildly across team.”
- **Impact**: Less time with buyers; pipeline inflated with junk; conversion and forecast suffer; reps feel like data-entry clerks.
- **Current Solutions**: Templates, ad-hoc notes, or acceptance of incomplete CRM and manual work.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Deal Execution Agent (auto notes, field extraction, multi-object writeback, MEDDIC Autopilot, prep + follow-up in Slack)
- **Key Message**: “Cut the time in half to progress deals in Salesforce. Notes and follow-ups automated so reps spend time selling.”

### 2. Pipeline and deal visibility only by chasing (CRM cop, Slack detective)
- **Description**: Managers log into Salesforce, Gong, Slack; DMs reps for updates; piece together a single deal across tabs. No centralized, real-time signal despite having conversation tools. “45–60 minutes/day” spent chasing clarity.
- **Impact**: Manager acts as pipeline detective; strategic time lost; deal health and next steps unclear until manually assembled.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual Gong searches, Slack DMs, custom reports, or living with lagging visibility.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Momentum auto-fills Salesforce; Slack alerts (deal health, budget, legal, ghosting); transcript moment + quote in Slack so manager doesn’t search Gong.
- **Key Message**: “From chasing clarity → to leading with visibility. Time saved: 45–60 min/day.”

### 3. Forecast and pipeline review on gut and guesswork
- **Description**: Forecast built from rep opinion and manual Gong checks. “Why is this in commit?” “Did we confirm timeline or are we hoping?” — unanswered in QBRs. CI tools give access but not action.
- **Impact**: Forecast surprises; last-minute scrambles; static rollups instead of call-backed pipeline inspection.
- **Current Solutions**: Custom notes for leadership, manual cross-checks, or acceptance of best-guess forecast.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly (forecast and pipeline meetings)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI CRO; signal-based forecast; MEDDPICC and timeline from calls; Slack summary (“Deal XYZ → Slipping. Reason: …”)
- **Key Message**: “From static rollups → dynamic, call-backed pipeline inspection. Forecast with confidence.”

### 4. Coaching by memory or Gong archaeology; not scalable
- **Description**: Managers prep 1:1s by digging through Gong, listening to 2–3 calls per rep; coaching is ad hoc and reactive. No system for coachable moments; SDRs rarely hear what “good” sounds like; ramp inconsistent.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent execution; long ramp; enablement and coaching not tied to what actually wins; top performer behaviors not replicated.
- **Current Solutions**: Shadowing 1–2 calls, best-effort feedback, or acceptance of uneven performance.
- **Frequency**: Weekly (1:1s, pipeline reviews)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Coaching Agent (every call scored, scorecards, Slack alerts for missed talk tracks); SmartClips (“Best Objection Handling,” “Top Openers”); compliance dashboards.
- **Key Message**: “From scattered feedback → systemized, data-backed coaching. Ramp time cut in half.”

### 5. Weak handoffs and messaging blindspots (SDR→AE; field→enablement)
- **Description**: SDR handoffs like “they’re interested in a demo”; AE walks in blind. Reps go off-script; enablement hears objection trends weeks later. No feedback loop from field to enablement; “Are we explaining the product wrong?” is guesswork.
- **Impact**: Low conversion on SDR-booked meetings; AE skepticism; enablement and product react too late.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual briefs, Slack fragments, or postmortems after the fact.
- **Frequency**: Per deal / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Automated handoff briefs (goals, objections, qualification, SmartClips); real-time signal routing to Enablement/Product/Marketing (objections, compliance, feature requests).
- **Key Message**: “Handoff brief in AE’s Slack + Salesforce — zero info lost. Issues addressed same day, not weeks later.”

### 6. Prep and messaging guesswork (SDR)
- **Description**: SDRs spend 30–45 min in Salesforce, LinkedIn, Gong to prep; messaging inconsistent; no visibility into which openers convert. Multitasking on calls: missing qualification, compliance slips, vague next steps.
- **Impact**: Time spent researching instead of dialing; inconsistent discovery and compliance; conversion and ramp suffer.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual prep, script adherence by discipline, or acceptance of variability.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI Account Briefs in Slack/Teams; signals on which intros perform; SmartClips “Top Openers”; live compliance and qualification flags; Autopilot updates Salesforce.
- **Key Message**: “Smart prep + messaging signals. Every discovery call consistent, compliant, and fully documented.”

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time do reps and managers spend on notes, CRM updates, and chasing deal context vs. selling and coaching?
2. When you do pipeline or forecast reviews, where does the “real” context come from — CRM, Gong, or Slack?
3. How do you coach reps today, and how do you know what top performers do differently?
4. How complete are SDR→AE handoffs, and when do Enablement and Product hear about objection or messaging trends?

## Trigger Events
- Missed quarter or forecast miss; “we need better visibility”
- New sales or RevOps leader; push for CRM hygiene and pipeline accuracy
- Ramp time or win rate under pressure; coaching at scale
- Scaling team without proportionally scaling admin
