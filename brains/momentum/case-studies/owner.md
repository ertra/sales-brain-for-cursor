# Case Study: Owner.com

## Snapshot

| | |

| **Industry** | Technology / SaaS |

| **Primary Persona** | CRO, RevOps, Sales Leader |
| **Use Case** | Order of magnitude better data; decisions with clarity and speed; coaching at scale |

## Executive Summary
Owner.com uses Momentum for pipeline, rep, and account visibility—getting "order of magnitude better data" and making "decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before." Leadership also uses Momentum for coaching at scale—"like a sales manager that works 24/7"—and for increasing the probability that reps do the right things.

## The Challenge
- Need for data-driven decisions; forecast and pipeline not grounded in what was actually said and done
- Coaching and rep consistency at scale; replicating top performer behaviors

## The Solution
- AI CRO: pipeline, rep, and account insights; briefs and visibility
- Deal Execution: data quality and writeback from every interaction
- Coaching Agent: every-call scoring; "sales manager that works 24/7"; SmartClips and scorecards

## The Results
- **Order of magnitude better data**: "Momentum gives us an order of magnitude better data than we've ever had before. We're making decisions with clarity and speed that simply weren't possible before."
- **Coaching at scale**: "It's like having a sales manager that works 24/7, providing insights we never thought possible."
- **Rep behavior**: "Momentum substantially increases the probability of reps doing the right things. It's the #1 thing I mention to friends in RevOps—'Let me show you something that will change your world.'"
