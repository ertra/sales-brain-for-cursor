# Case Study: 1Password

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | 1Password |
| **Industry** | Technology / Security (SaaS) |
| **Products Used** | Deal Execution Agent, AI CRO / visibility, Slack |
| **Primary Persona** | RevOps (VP RevOps), Sales leadership |
| **Use Case** | Insight at scale; reps spend time selling; no notes/field admin |

## Executive Summary
1Password uses Momentum so reps aren't spending time on notes and filling out fields—they're spending their time selling. Momentum delivers "insight at scale" and keeps Salesforce updated automatically, so leadership and RevOps get visibility without chasing reps.

## The Challenge
- Reps buried in admin (notes, CRM updates); need to free time for selling
- Need for insight at scale across pipeline and team without manual synthesis

## The Solution
- Deal Execution Agent: automatic notes and field updates; prep and follow-up in Slack
- AI CRO / visibility: pipeline and team insights from real data
- Slack as command center: alerts and context where the team works

## The Results
- **Insight at scale**: "The most important thing Momentum delivers for me is insight at scale. Reps aren't spending their time making notes or filling out fields. They're spending their time selling."
- Reps focused on selling; data and visibility flow automatically
