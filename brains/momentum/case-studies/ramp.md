# Case Study: Ramp

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Ramp |
| **Industry** | Financial Services |
| **Company Size** | 501–1,000 |
| **Location** | New York, New York |
| **Products Used** | Deal Execution Agent, Slack integration, CRM enrichment, AI-driven alerts, MEDDIC/autopilot |
| **Primary Persona** | RevOps (Head of GTM Systems), Sales / GTM teams |
| **Use Case** | Scale rep productivity; one source of truth; deal progression; data quality; organizational clarity |

## Executive Summary
Ramp, a hypergrowth financial services/SaaS company, needed one centralized reporting repository and operational efficiency while scaling. Momentum became integral to GTM operations: deal progression automation in Slack, AI-driven alerts ("like a sales manager that stays up 24/7"), and CRM enrichment from every call. **Result: cut the time in half for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce;** improved data quality ("huge lift for our operations side"); seller productivity gains; and organizational clarity across RevOps and GTM teams.

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- Maintaining operational efficiency while scaling rapidly
- Fragmented data and processes; misaligned reporting
- "We needed one clear centralized reporting repository, making sure that everybody's reading from the same sheet of paper."
- Inefficiencies in deal progression; data inconsistencies
- Growing pains: vendor relationships, Salesforce access permissions, deal routing
- "We're always trying new things, solving new challenges, and experimenting quite a bit"—existing tools and processes not agile enough

### Key Pain Points
- No single source of truth; everyone not "reading from the same sheet of paper"
- Deal progression slow; sellers "diving into Salesforce" to progress deals
- Data quality issues; information incorrect or missing
- Need for flexibility and speed of feature development

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Momentum
- **Team and roadmap**: "We did a very deep evaluation before selecting Momentum, and it was largely because of the team." Momentum's focus on AI and GTM efficiency resonated; "they understand the needs of a RevOps team and a hypergrowth sales team."
- **Slack-centric**: "We wanted a tool that could take Salesforce information and bring that into Slack and vice versa—managing all of our internal communications there and also managing our CRM through Slack."

### How They Use Momentum
| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Deal progression automation** | "With Momentum, we'll draft up an email for our account executives, send them that alert in Slack, and they're able to progress the deal without diving into Salesforce." |
| **Enhanced alerts and reporting** | "Momentum is really like a sales manager that stays up 24/7 and listens to every Gong call, notifying the right folks when they should be paying attention to a deal." |
| **CRM enrichment** | Momentum analyzes customer calls and transcripts; "it gives visibility to the seller later on, summarizing key information from calls and dropping it into our CRM." |
| **AI-driven insights** | Extract product feedback and co-selling opportunities; "we can ask Momentum to listen to those calls for us and notify the relevant parties." |
| **Operational efficiency** | "Momentum's been a great tool in surfacing information that may be incorrect and notifying our team to fix the data." |

## The Results

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Time to progress deals in Salesforce | Baseline | Half | **Cut in half** |
| Data quality | Inconsistent | Consistent, clean | "Huge lift for our operations side" |
| Seller time in Salesforce | Higher | Reduced | "More time helping our customers" |
| Organizational alignment | Fragmented | Clarity | "Clarity across RevOps unit and GTM teams" |

### Headline Results
- **Cut the time in half** for sellers to progress their deals in Salesforce
- **Improved data quality**; "huge lift for our operations side"
- **Seller productivity gains**; less time in Salesforce, more time with customers
- **Organizational clarity** across RevOps and GTM teams

- "Momentum has been a great partner to us because they've been embedded with us."
