# Gong → Revenue Leader (CRO) Value Proposition

## Summary
For CROs and revenue executives, Gong delivers predictable growth with complete, unbiased visibility into forecast, pipeline, and strategy execution — in one place. Align sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps; reduce non-selling work; and close the gap between plan and performance so you hit your revenue goals every time.

## The Problem
Revenue leaders face forecast surprises, siloed GTM teams, and too much time spent on manual reporting and firefighting. Churn and renewal risk show up too late. Replicating winning behaviors and turning strategy into consistent execution is hard without one source of truth.

## The Solution
