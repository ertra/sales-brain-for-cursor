# Gong → Revenue Operations Value Proposition

## Summary
For RevOps, Gong is the single source of truth that automates workflows, powers your data engine, and aligns teams. Shift from reactive reporting to strategic initiatives with AI-driven insights, and turn winning behaviors into scalable workflows — all on one platform with 250+ integrations (Gong Collective).

## The Problem
RevOps is stuck with fragmented data across CRM and tools, reactive reporting instead of strategic work, and difficulty proving the impact of initiatives. The field and RevOps often don’t trust the same numbers.

## The Solution
Revenue Graph unifies every interaction and business context; Forecast and Intelligence surface leading indicators and risk. Automation and Agents reduce manual work. Gong Collective keeps CRM and systems in sync so there’s one source of truth.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Single source of truth
- **Benefit**: One place for pipeline, activity, and outcomes; no more reconciling spreadsheets and tools.
- **Proof Point**: Automatic capture + 250+ integrations; Frontify: 30% lead conversion when RevOps and reps aligned.
- **Customer Quote**: "Consolidation has been the main driver — one platform where you can do everything, from pipeline management to forecasting, with productivity and sophisticated insights." — Naya Tsoukala, Head of Revenue Operations, Frontify

### 2. Strategic instead of reactive
- **Benefit**: AI-driven insights and leading indicators; time for initiatives, not just report pulls.
- **Proof Point**: Pipeline and forecast fed by Revenue Graph; deal and renewal signals in real time.
- **Customer Quote**: (Use Frontify and platform proof — strategic alignment and predictable growth.)

### 3. Prove and scale what works
- **Benefit**: Tie programs and behaviors to win rates, deal velocity, pipeline conversion; turn winning behaviors into workflows.
- **Proof Point**: Execution and adoption visible in platform; methodology and initiative impact (e.g. win rate, conversion) demonstrable.
