# Gong → Customer Success Value Proposition

## Summary
For customer success leaders and CSMs, Gong turns post-sale data into action: full visibility into customer interactions, early signals for renewal and churn risk, and faster ramp for new CSMs. Reduce churn, grow accounts, and align with sales and product on one account story — so you retain and expand with confidence.

## The Problem
CS chases context across systems; renewal and churn risk appear too late. New CSMs ramp slowly. Handoffs from sales to CS are incomplete, and there’s no shared view of the account.

## The Solution
Revenue Graph gives one place for every customer interaction and account context. Forecast and signals surface renewal likelihood and risk early. Engage and collaboration features keep sales, CS, and product aligned on the same account story so you act before it’s too late.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Full visibility; stop chasing context
- **Benefit**: One place for pipeline and customer interactions; assess health and flag risks without digging.
- **Proof Point**: Full account story (past convos, key moments, next steps) for the whole team.
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning: "Know where you stand" — full visibility into pipeline and interactions.)

### 2. Renewal and churn risk early
- **Benefit**: Track renewal likelihood and churn risk with signals (engagement, feedback, pricing); act before it’s too late.
- **Proof Point**: Turn customer signals into forecast certainty; improve pipeline management and revenue decisions.
- **Customer Quote**: "What separates Gong is the insights I can grab from customer interactions at scale. Our teams can turn those insights into actions that improve pipeline management and help us make better revenue decisions." — Eric Stoddard, Head of Global Sales & CS Enablement

### 3. Ramp and align CS teams faster
- **Benefit**: New CSMs get centralized context and less admin; ramp time drops (e.g. six months to two).
- **Proof Point**: Onboarding time significantly decreased with Gong; managers coach from reality, not hearsay.
- **Customer Quote**: "Our onboarding time was shrinking from six months to five to four. Today I'm able to onboard a brand new CSM within just over two months down from six months pre-Gong." — Vaishali Reed, Director of Global Customer Success & Programs Operations

## Quantified Value

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| CSM ramp time | 6+ months | Centralized context, less admin | e.g. down to ~2 months (Vaishali Reed) |
| When renewal risk is visible | Late in cycle | Early signals (engagement, feedback) | Act before too late |
| Sales–CS handoff | Incomplete, duplicate work | One account story, aligned | Fewer gaps, faster action |
