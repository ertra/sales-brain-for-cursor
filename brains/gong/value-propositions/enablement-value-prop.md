# Gong → Enablement Value Proposition

## Summary
For enablement leaders, Gong turns enablement programs into revenue: connect training to win rates and deal velocity, ramp reps faster with onboarding built from real conversations, and prove impact with execution and adoption data. Go from support function to strategic driver and turn managers into enablement multipliers.

## The Problem
Enablement is measured by completion rates, not outcomes; the gap between learning and landing the deal is unclear. Ramp times are long, and managers lack the visibility to coach where it counts. Proving ROI to leadership is hard.

## The Solution
Revenue Graph and platform visibility show how rep behavior and coaching impact the bottom line. Onboarding and skill gaps are informed by real customer conversations; execution and adoption data tie programs to win rates and deal velocity. Managers get coaching moments and messaging gaps so they can reinforce what works.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Prove impact on revenue
- **Benefit**: Link enablement to win rates, deal velocity, pipeline coverage; show impact, not just effort.
- **Proof Point**: Culture Amp: deal velocity improvement with methodology tracking; Highspot: +7% win rates with methodology.
- **Customer Quote**: "We have been able to show that by utilizing the methodology win rates increase by 7%." — Alicia Heagle, Manager Revenue Enablement - Sales, Highspot

### 2. Bridge learning and landing
- **Benefit**: See if reps apply what they’ve learned; clear data on execution and adoption; know what’s sticking and what to do next.
- **Proof Point**: Track methodology adherence and tie to deal velocity; objective view of rep behavior in deals.
- **Customer Quote**: "We tracked the percentage of use of 'next steps' over time and set a target for that to increase. Through that, we were able to see an improvement in our deal velocity." — Simon Kirk, VP Revenue Enablement, Culture Amp

### 3. Accelerate ramp; scale coaching
- **Benefit**: Onboarding built from real conversations; pinpoint skill gaps and methodology adherence; cut ramp time (e.g. in half).
- **Proof Point**: Iron Mountain: onboarding times cut in half; managers surface coaching moments and reinforce winning behaviors.
- **Customer Quote**: "We're cutting onboarding times in half. And we measure that based on how long it takes you to come in, learn the products, get in touch with your customers and start hitting your number." — Christine Canfield, VP SMB Inside Sales, Iron Mountain

## Quantified Value

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Ramp time | Long (months) | Onboarding from real conversations | e.g. cut in half (Iron Mountain) |
| Win rate (methodology/execution) | Baseline | Tracked, reinforced | e.g. +7% (Highspot) |
| Deal velocity (methodology use) | Unknown | Measured, improved | e.g. Culture Amp next-steps tracking |
