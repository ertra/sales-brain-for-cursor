# Revenue Operations - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from RevOps when evaluating Gong. Focus on consolidation, single source of truth, integrations, and competition. See also [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, and authority.

## Objections

### 1. Consolidation: "We have too many tools already"

**Why They Say This**:
Tool sprawl; budget and complexity; or fear of adding another system. RevOps often owns the stack.

**Acknowledge**:
"Too many tools is a real issue — and RevOps carries the burden."

**Respond**:
"Gong is often the consolidation move. You get one Revenue Graph and one platform for capture, forecast, engagement, and agents — and with the Collective we have 250+ integrations so you're not starting from zero. So the story isn't 'one more tool'; it's 'one source of truth' that can replace or sit on top of point solutions. Frontify called consolidation the main driver and saw 30% lead conversion when RevOps and reps aligned on one platform. What would need to be true for you to retire or reduce 1–2 tools and run more on Gong?"

**Proof Point**:
- Frontify: "Consolidation has been the main driver — one platform where you can do everything, from pipeline management to forecasting"
- 30% increase in lead conversion when RevOps and reps aligned
- Gong Collective: 250+ integrations (Salesforce, Zoom, Slack, Snowflake, etc.)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Which tools are non-negotiable today, and which could be consolidated if there were one platform with one data layer?"

### 2. Integration: "We need it to work with our CRM and data stack"

**Why They Say This**:
RevOps and IT need bi-directional sync, security, and no more fragile point-to-point. They've been burned by integration gaps.

**Acknowledge**:
"Integrations and data flow are make-or-break for RevOps."

**Respond**:
"The Collective is built for that: 250+ integrations including Salesforce, Zoom, Slack, Okta, Snowflake, Databricks, and more. Data flows into the Revenue Graph and back to CRM and your stack so you have one source of truth without rebuilding everything. We're built for enterprise: security, compliance, and governance so RevOps and IT are comfortable. I can walk through your specific stack and show how Gong fits. What's the one integration or data flow that's non-negotiable?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gong Collective: 250+ integrations; bi-directional CRM sync; no-code options (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks)
- Enterprise security and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)
- Frontify: "one platform"; Naya Tsoukala (Head of RevOps) on consolidation and insights

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's broken or fragile in your current integration and data flow that you'd want Gong to fix?"

### 3. Competition: "We're evaluating Salesloft / Clari for platform"

**Why They Say This**:
Salesloft for "one platform" narrative; Clari for forecast and RevOps workflow. They're comparing architecture and fit.

**Acknowledge**:
"They're both serious — and the choice is often about architecture."

**Respond**:
"The differentiator is the data layer. With Gong, the product is the Revenue Graph: one graph of every customer interaction. Forecast, engagement, and risk are apps on top of that. With Clari, it's forecast and pipeline process; with Salesloft, it's workflow and engagement with intelligence added. So the question is whether you want one source of truth for every interaction — and forecast and engagement powered by that — or one vendor for workflow. We win when RevOps wants the data layer to be the strategy. Gartner positioned us as Leader in Revenue Action Orchestration. What would success look like for you in 12 months — one workflow vendor or one revenue data layer?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gartner Leader (Revenue Action Orchestration); Ability to Execute, Completeness of Vision
- Revenue Graph: single data layer; Clari/Salesloft different architecture
- Frontify: 30% conversion with alignment; "strategic alignment and predictable growth on a unified platform"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When you say 'one platform,' do you mean one vendor for workflows or one source of truth for every revenue interaction?"

---

### 4. Status Quo: "We already have a data warehouse / BI for pipeline"

**Why They Say This**:
They've invested in Snowflake, Databricks, or BI; they think "we have the data" and don't need Gong.

**Acknowledge**:
"If you've invested in data and BI, you're ahead of a lot of teams."

**Respond**:
"The gap is usually that your warehouse and BI are fed by CRM and activity logs — not by what was said in every call and email. Gong captures every interaction and maps it to deals and accounts; you can sync that into Snowflake or Databricks so your existing stack gets conversation-backed data. So we're not replacing your warehouse; we're making it richer. Deal risk, forecast signals, and rep behavior then flow into the same place you already use. Would it help to see how Gong data plugs into your current data and BI setup?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gong Collective: Snowflake, Databricks integrations; sync Gong data in minutes, no code
- Revenue Graph: every interaction; not just CRM fields
- "Shift from reactive to strategic" — power initiatives with AI-driven insights from revenue data

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where does your pipeline and forecast data come from today — and does it include conversation and engagement content?"
