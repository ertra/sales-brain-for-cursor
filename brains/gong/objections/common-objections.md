# Gong - Common Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections across revenue leaders, RevOps, sales, CS, and enablement — and how to handle them with Gong-specific proof and positioning.

## Objections

### 1. Price/Budget: "We don't have the budget" / "This is expensive"

**Why They Say This**:
Value isn't clear relative to cost; not a priority this cycle; or genuine budget constraint. Sometimes "we have other tools" = budget is spread across point solutions.

**Acknowledge**:
"Budget is always a consideration, especially when you're running a lean GTM org."

**Respond**:
"Most of our customers see the payback in productivity and predictability within the first quarters — fewer missed forecasts, more rep time selling, and often consolidation of other tools onto one platform. So the question is less 'can we afford Gong?' and more 'can we afford another quarter of forecast surprises or another year of reps buried in admin?' I can share an ROI frame that fits your world — for example, X hours saved per rep per week, or the cost of one missed deal. What would make this a no-brainer for your board or finance?"

**Proof Point**:
- Uber for Business: 6,700 hours saved across call prep, follow-up, CRM updates; 32% lift in buyer response with AI Tracker
- EdgePetrol: 300% increase in pipeline feed with time reallocated; CRO: "I couldn't live without Gong now"
- Frontify: 30% lead conversion increase with alignment (consolidation and one platform)
- Iron Mountain: onboarding times cut in half (enablement/ramp ROI)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would need to be true for this to be a clear yes from a budget perspective — and who else needs to be aligned on that?"

### 2. Timing: "Not the right time" / "Let's revisit next quarter"

**Why They Say This**:
Other priorities (e.g. CRM migration, reorg); not urgent enough; or avoiding the decision. Sometimes they're in the middle of a long evaluation with another vendor.

**Acknowledge**:
"Timing is always a factor — and you know your calendar better than I do."

**Respond**:
"The cost of waiting is usually another quarter of the same: forecast surprises, siloed data, or reps still drowning in admin. We see customers who wished they'd started sooner because the data layer — the Revenue Graph — gets more valuable over time. Even a focused pilot (e.g. one segment or one use case like forecast or engagement) can prove value before a full rollout. What would need to shift for this to become a priority in the next 90 days?"

**Proof Point**:
- Value compounds: Revenue Graph and conversation-backed forecast improve as more interactions are captured
- Pilot approach: start with forecast or engagement; expand once value is clear
- Customers cite "faster, more accurate decisions" and productivity gains within first quarters

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's on the roadmap for the next two quarters that might make this the right time — or that we could align with?"

---

### 3. Competition: "We're looking at Salesloft / Outreach / Clari"

**Why They Say This**:
Doing due diligence; existing relationship with another vendor; or they see value in an alternative (engagement depth, forecast process, etc.).

**Acknowledge**:
"They're serious players. It's smart to compare."

**Respond**:
"The real differentiator is where the data lives. Gong is built around the Revenue Graph — one graph of every customer interaction. So your forecast, deal risk, and engagement are all grounded in what was actually said and done in calls and emails, not just CRM and activity logs. With others, conversation intelligence is often one module or an add-on to an engagement or forecast tool. With Gong, the product is the revenue data layer; everything else is built on top. So the question is: do you want workflow unification (one vendor for cadences, calls, deals) or data unification (one source of truth for every interaction)? We win when data and predictability are the strategy. I'm happy to do a focused comparison on the 2–3 things that matter most to you."

**Proof Point**:
- Gartner Leader in 2025 Magic Quadrant for Revenue Action Orchestration (Ability to Execute, Completeness of Vision)
- Revenue Graph: single data layer; competitors typically engagement-first or forecast-process-first
- Customer quotes: "faster, more accurate decisions" (CRO); forecast "ownership and accountability" (Crayon); 30% conversion with alignment (Frontify)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's the single most important outcome you're trying to get from this decision — forecast accuracy, rep productivity, alignment, or something else?"

---

### 4. Status Quo: "We're fine with what we have" / "We already have conversation intelligence"

**Why They Say This**:
Change is hard; they don't see the problem; or they're comfortable with current tools (e.g. existing CI, CRM, spreadsheets).

**Acknowledge**:
"If what you have is working, that's a good place to be."

**Respond**:
"The question is whether 'working' means you're getting the full picture. A lot of teams have call recording or a conversation tool, but their forecast is still based on CRM and gut feel — not what was said in every call and email. So you might be fine for today, but leaving predictability and productivity on the table. We're not asking you to rip and replace overnight; we're asking whether you want one graph of every revenue interaction that powers forecast, engagement, and risk. If that's not a priority, staying put is rational. If it is, we can show what 'good' looks like with that data layer in place."

**Proof Point**:
- Many Gong customers had CI or other tools before; they consolidated for one source of truth and conversation-backed forecast
- Cost of status quo: forecast surprises, silos, admin burden (see pain points and use cases)
- "What separates Gong is the insights I can grab from customer interactions at scale" — Eric Stoddard (Head of Global Sales & CS Enablement)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where do you feel best set up today — and where do you still have gaps (forecast, alignment, rep productivity)?"

### 5. Authority: "I need to check with my boss / RevOps / finance"

**Why They Say This**:
Genuine need for buy-in (CRO, RevOps, procurement); or using as a delay tactic. Often the champion is not the economic buyer.

**Acknowledge**:
"Makes sense — big decisions usually involve more than one person."

**Respond**:
"We can make that easier. I can put together a one-pager or deck that speaks to your boss's or RevOps' priorities — for example, forecast accuracy and one source of truth for the number, or productivity and consolidation. We also have ROI frames and customer proof (e.g. 6,700 hours saved, 30% conversion lift, ramp cut in half) that help internal conversations. Would it help if we did a short joint call with your boss or RevOps so they can hear the differentiation and ask their own questions?"

**Proof Point**:
- Case studies and quotes by persona (CRO, RevOps, Sales, CS, Enablement)
- Gartner/Forrester for executive and procurement
- ROI and use-case one-pagers (forecast, productivity, alignment, ramp, churn)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Who else is in the decision process, and what would they need to see to get to yes?"

---

### 6. Consolidation / "We have too many tools already"

**Why They Say This**:
Tool fatigue; budget spread across point solutions; or fear of adding another vendor. RevOps and IT often lead this objection.

**Acknowledge**:
"Too many tools is a real problem — and no one wants to add more for the sake of it."

**Respond**:
"Gong is often a consolidation play. You get one Revenue Graph and one platform for capture, forecast, engagement, and — where it makes sense — you can retire or reduce reliance on other point tools. So the move isn't 'one more tool'; it's 'one source of truth and one OS' that can replace or sit on top of what you have. We have 250+ integrations (Gong Collective) so you're not starting from zero. The question is whether you want to keep stitching together CI, engagement, forecast, and CS tools, or run revenue on one data layer and one platform."

**Proof Point**:
- Frontify: "Consolidation has been the main driver — one platform where you can do everything"
- Collective: 250+ integrations; CRM and key tools sync to Gong
- Single contract and one data layer vs. multiple point solutions

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Which tools today are non-negotiable, and which could be consolidated if there were a better single platform?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "What's driving this evaluation — forecast accuracy, productivity, alignment, or something else?"
2. "How do you get to your number today, and how often does the actual result match the forecast?"
3. "Who's involved in the decision, and what would they need to see to get to yes?"
4. "Are you evaluating other vendors, and what would make you choose one over the other?"
5. "What would need to be true for this to be a clear yes from a budget and timing perspective?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're just exploring" with no timeline or decision criteria
- Champion can't articulate ROI or internal story for their boss
- Budget or procurement brought up very late with no prior discovery
- Competitor named as "we're probably going with them" without a real comparison
