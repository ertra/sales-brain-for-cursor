# Customer Success - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from CS leaders and CSMs when evaluating Gong. Focus on ramp, churn visibility, "we have a CS tool," and adoption. See also [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, and authority.

## Objections

### 1. "We already have Gainsight / ChurnZero / a CS platform"

**Why They Say This**:
They've invested in a dedicated CS tool; they don't see why they need Gong for post-sale.

**Acknowledge**:
"If you have a CS platform, you've got a foundation for health and playbooks."

**Respond**:
"The gap is usually that your CS platform is fed by product usage and maybe support tickets — not by every customer conversation. Gong captures every call, meeting, and email post-sale and connects it to accounts. So you see renewal and churn risk from what was actually said — engagement drop, pricing concerns, sentiment — not just usage scores. We integrate with Gainsight, ChurnZero, and others so your existing CS stack gets conversation-backed data. So it's not Gong instead of your CS tool; it's Gong making your CS tool smarter with the voice of the customer. What signals do you use today to predict churn — and do they include conversation data?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gong integrations: Gainsight, ChurnZero, Accord, BackEngine, Clozd (see customer-success solution page)
- "Turn customer signals into forecast certainty"; "unlock what's really happening post-sale"
- Vaishali Reed: ramp from 6 months to ~2 months with Gong as source of context
- Eric Stoddard: "insights from customer interactions at scale" → actions for pipeline and revenue decisions

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When you get early warning that a renewal is at risk, where does that signal come from today?"

### 2. Adoption: "CSMs won't use another tool"

**Why They Say This**:
Tool fatigue; CSMs are busy; or they're worried about low adoption.

**Acknowledge**:
"CSMs are stretched — adding another login is a real concern."

**Respond**:
"Gong gives CSMs context without asking them to log in to 'do Gong.' Every customer interaction is captured and mapped to the account, so when a CSM opens an account they see the full story — past convos, key moments, next steps — without chasing sales or support. New CSMs ramp faster because the context is in one place. So adoption is driven by value: less time chasing context, more time with customers. We've seen onboarding time drop from six months to two. What would make your CSMs want to use this — less digging for context or something else?"

**Proof Point**:
- Vaishali Reed: "Onboarding time was shrinking from six months to five to four. Today I'm able to onboard a brand new CSM within just over two months down from six months pre-Gong."
- "Stop chasing context"; "full visibility into customer interactions and pipeline"
- Jeffrey Coleman (CCO): managers "see what's really happening"; "coach, support, and celebrate"; "improving outcomes for our team and for our clients"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"How long does it take a new CSM to feel fully up to speed today — and where do they get account context?"

### 3. Price: "We can't justify this for CS alone"

**Why They Say This**:
CS budget is separate or smaller; they're not sure ROI is clear for post-sale.

**Acknowledge**:
"CS often has to fight for budget — I get it."

**Respond**:
"The ROI story for CS is retention and expansion: see risk earlier, ramp CSMs faster, and align with sales on the same account story. When onboarding drops from six months to two, you're saving salary and accelerating time-to-value for customers. When you act on churn signals before it's too late, you're protecting revenue. We can frame it as cost of churn or cost of long ramp vs. investment in Gong. What would your finance or CRO need to see to say yes for CS?"

**Proof Point**:
- Vaishali Reed: 6 months → ~2 months ramp (salary and time-to-value)
- "Turn customer signals into forecast certainty"; "identify risks early, drive renewals"
- "Turn CS into revenue success" — CRO visibility into renewal and expansion
- Eric Stoddard: insights at scale → better pipeline and revenue decisions

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's the cost of one unexpected churn or one CSM taking six months to ramp — and how would you quantify avoiding that?"

---

### 4. Timing: "We're focused on sales tools first"

**Why They Say This**:
CS is lower priority than sales or RevOps; or they're waiting for sales to adopt Gong first.

**Acknowledge**:
"Sales often leads the evaluation — that's common."

**Respond**:
"Gong is one platform: when sales is on Gong, CS gets the same data — every call and email with the customer, before and after the handoff. So the best time for CS is often when sales is rolling out, so you're not building context in silos. If sales is already on Gong, CS can plug in and get full account visibility and renewal signals from day one. If sales isn't on yet, we can still show the CS story: ramp, risk, and alignment. What's the timeline for sales — and could CS be part of the same rollout?"

**Proof Point**:
- One Revenue Graph: sales and CS on same data; handoff and expansion in one place
- "Strengthen collaboration — from sales to proserv to product, give everyone the full account story"
- "Unite teams on customer-led growth"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When sales hands off to CS, do both teams have the same view of the account today — or is context lost?"
