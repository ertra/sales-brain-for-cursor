# Revenue Leader (CRO) - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from CROs and revenue executives when evaluating Gong. Focus on forecast, alignment, board/finance, and strategic platform choice. See also [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, competition, and authority.

## Objections

### 1. Price/Budget: "We need to justify this to the board / finance"

**Why They Say This**:
Board or finance wants clear ROI; CRO has to defend spend; or they're comparing to "do nothing" or a cheaper point tool.

**Acknowledge**:
"Board and finance want to see the return — that's their job."

**Respond**:
"The story that resonates is predictability and productivity: fewer forecast surprises, one source of truth for the number, and more rep time selling instead of admin. We can frame it as cost of inaction — one missed quarter or one lost deal — and as payback: for example, X hours per rep per week back, or the value of 30% better conversion when RevOps and reps are aligned. I can leave you with a one-pager that your CFO or board can use. What metric would make this an easy yes for them?"

**Proof Point**:
- Mike Wolff (CRO): "Faster, more accurate, and more informed decisions"
- EdgePetrol: 300% pipeline feed; "I couldn't live without Gong now"
- Frontify: 30% lead conversion with alignment; consolidation as main driver
- Crayon: forecast ownership and accountability; "devote more time to deals that actually need our attention"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What does the board or finance care about most — forecast accuracy, productivity, or consolidation?"

### 2. Timing: "We're in the middle of a reorg / CRM migration"

**Why They Say This**:
Legitimate competing priority; or using as a reason to delay. CRO doesn't want to add change load.

**Acknowledge**:
"Reorgs and migrations are all-consuming — I get it."

**Respond**:
"Some customers actually use a Gong rollout as part of the reorg or migration — one new source of truth and one platform so the new structure runs on better data from day one. Others do a focused pilot (e.g. forecast or one segment) so you're not boiling the ocean. The cost of waiting is another quarter of the same forecast and alignment issues. What would need to be true for this to run in parallel or right after the migration?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gong Collective: 250+ integrations; works with existing CRM and tools
- Pilot approach: prove value in one use case or segment before full rollout
- Value compounds: Revenue Graph gets better with more data over time

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When do you need the new structure or CRM to be 'done' — and could Gong be part of that definition of done?"

---

### 3. Competition: "We're leaning toward Salesloft / Outreach / Clari"

**Why They Say This**:
They like the other vendor's story (unified workflow, engagement maturity, forecast process); or existing relationship.

**Acknowledge**:
"They're good companies. The choice usually comes down to what you're optimizing for."

**Respond**:
"If you're optimizing for one data layer — one graph of every customer interaction that powers your forecast and your engagement — Gong is built for that. If you're optimizing for the most mature sales engagement product or a specific forecast workflow, someone else might fit. We win when the CRO and RevOps want the number and the pipeline grounded in what was actually said in every call and email, and when you want one Revenue AI OS, not engagement-plus-intelligence. Gartner positioned us as Leader in Revenue Action Orchestration for a reason. What's the one outcome that would define success for you?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gartner Leader 2025 Magic Quadrant (Revenue Action Orchestration); Ability to Execute, Completeness of Vision
- Revenue Graph vs. workflow-first or process-first alternatives
- Customer quotes: predictability, "faster decisions," alignment (Frontify, Crayon, DemandScience)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When you imagine your ideal state in 12 months, is it 'one vendor for workflow' or 'one source of truth for every revenue interaction'?"

---

### 4. Status Quo: "We already have a forecast tool / conversation intelligence"

**Why They Say This**:
They have Clari, Chorus, or another CI/forecast tool; don't see the need to switch or add.

**Acknowledge**:
"If it's working, that's valuable."

**Respond**:
"The question is whether your forecast is fed by every customer interaction — calls, emails, meetings — or by CRM and manual input. With Gong, the Revenue Graph is the product: one graph of every interaction, then forecast and engagement on top. So you're not adding another forecast tool; you're replacing the data that feeds the number. A lot of our customers had a forecast or CI tool before and consolidated onto Gong for that reason. I'm happy to do a focused comparison: where does your forecast get its signals today, and what would change if it had the Revenue Graph behind it?"

**Proof Point**:
- Conversation-backed forecast: deal risk and pipeline from what was said, not just CRM
- Crayon: "ownership and accountability"; "complete transparency"; "more time to deals that need our attention"
- Many Gong customers consolidated from other CI or forecast tools

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where does your current forecast get its deal and pipeline signals — from rep input and CRM, or from conversation and engagement data?"

---

### 5. Authority: "I need alignment with RevOps / sales / finance"

**Why They Say This**:
CRO doesn't decide alone; RevOps, sales leadership, or finance must buy in.

**Acknowledge**:
"Big decisions need alignment — that's right."

**Respond**:
"We can help. RevOps usually cares about single source of truth and consolidation; sales cares about productivity and not another tool; finance cares about ROI and predictability. I can tailor a short deck or one-pager for each, and we can do a joint call so they hear the differentiation and ask their questions. What would make it easy for RevOps and sales to say yes?"

**Proof Point**:
- Frontify (RevOps): 30% conversion, consolidation, "one platform"
- EdgePetrol (CRO): 300% pipeline feed; "I couldn't live without Gong now"
- Crayon (Sales): forecast ownership, "more time to deals that need our attention"
- Case studies and Gartner for board/finance

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Who's the hardest to get over the line — and what would they need to see?"
