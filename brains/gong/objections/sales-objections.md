# Sales - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from sales leaders and reps when evaluating Gong. Focus on adoption, "another tool," productivity, and competition. See also [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, and authority.

## Objections

### 1. Adoption: "My reps won't use another tool"

**Why They Say This**:
Tool fatigue; fear of low adoption; or past failure with a similar product. Sales leaders don't want to force another system.

**Acknowledge**:
"Rep adoption is make-or-break — I hear that all the time."

**Respond**:
"Gong is different because it gives reps time back instead of asking for more input. We capture every call and meeting automatically; AI generates summaries and suggests follow-ups. So reps don't log in to 'do Gong' — they get value from it without extra work. Adoption goes up when the tool makes their life easier. We can show rep-level proof: call/meeting booked ratio, conversion, and hours saved. What's been the main reason reps haven't adopted other tools in the past?"

**Proof Point**:
- Uber for Business: 6,700 hours saved; 32% lift in buyer response — rep productivity and outcomes
- "Gong's AI is mind-blowing... I know more about what's going on in my team's sales cycle... Their productivity is incredible." — Matt McGonegle, Director of Inside Sales
- Sisense ADR: improved call/meeting booked ratio and opportunity conversion; "get more familiar with prospects listening to previous calls"
- Auto-capture and Agents: less data entry, not more

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would make your reps actually want to use this — time back, better context, or something else?"

### 2. Price: "We can't justify the cost per seat"

**Why They Say This**:
Seat-based pricing feels high; they're comparing to a cheaper or free alternative; or value isn't clear per rep.

**Acknowledge**:
"Per-seat cost is real — you have to see the return."

**Respond**:
"The return is per-seat productivity: more time selling, better follow-up, and fewer dropped deals. If each rep gets even 5 hours back per week, that's meaningful pipeline and quota impact. We've seen 6,700 hours saved across a team, 32% lift in buyer response, and 300% pipeline feed increase when time is reallocated. So the question is what one rep's time is worth and whether you're leaving that on the table with manual notes and scattered context. I can frame it as cost per rep per week and what that time could generate in pipeline."

**Proof Point**:
- Uber for Business: 6,700 hours (prep, follow-up, CRM); 32% buyer response lift
- EdgePetrol: 300% pipeline feed; "I couldn't live without Gong now"
- SpotOn: +16% win rate through productivity gains
- Rep quotes: productivity, "mind-blowing," conversion and booked ratio

**Follow-Up Question**:
"How many hours per week do you think each rep spends on notes, follow-ups, and CRM updates — and what would 5 hours back mean for quota?"

### 3. Competition: "We're looking at Salesloft / Outreach for engagement"

**Why They Say This**:
They want best-in-class sequences/cadences; or they already use Salesloft/Outreach and are adding intelligence.

**Acknowledge**:
"They're strong in engagement — no argument."

**Respond**:
"The difference is where engagement gets its intelligence. With Gong, every touch is connected to the Revenue Graph — full context from every call and email. So sequences and next steps aren't generic; they're informed by what actually happened in the deal. If pure sequencing depth is the only criterion, they've been at it longer. If you want engagement that's powered by the richest revenue data — what was said, what's at risk, what the buyer cares about — that's Gong. What matters more for your team: depth of sequences or intelligence behind every touch?"

**Proof Point**:
- Gong Engage built on Revenue Graph; full account context
- 32% buyer response lift (Uber) when value props and touch are informed by data
- "Replace admin work with high-impact activities"; "turn outreach into outcomes"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When your reps run a sequence, do they have full context from every prior interaction — or are they working from CRM and memory?"

---

### 4. Status Quo: "We're fine with CRM and spreadsheets for forecast"

**Why They Say This**:
They don't see forecast as broken; or they're used to the current process and don't want change.

**Acknowledge**:
"If the number is landing and the board is happy, that's valid."

**Respond**:
"The question is whether the number is grounded in reality — what was said in calls and emails — or in rep input and gut feel. When deal risk and pipeline health come from the Revenue Graph, you see problems earlier and forecast with more confidence. We're not asking you to throw away your process; we're asking whether you want the data behind the number to be every customer interaction. A lot of sales leaders tell us they couldn't go back once they had that. What would need to change for you to feel the current forecast process isn't enough?"

**Proof Point**:
- Crayon: "ownership and accountability"; "complete transparency"; "more time to deals that need our attention"
- "Forecast your number with confidence"; deal alerts from pricing, competition, buyer activity
- SpotOn: +16% win rate; productivity and visibility linked to forecast and execution

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When a deal slips, how do you usually find out — from the rep updating the CRM or from signals in the conversation?"
