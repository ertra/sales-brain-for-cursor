# Enablement - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from enablement leaders when evaluating Gong. Focus on proving impact, "we have an LMS," budget for "training," and adoption. See also [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, and authority.

## Objections

### 1. "We can't prove ROI — how do I show enablement drives revenue?"

**Why They Say This**:
Enablement is measured by completion rates; they're under pressure to tie training to win rate, deal velocity, or pipeline. Budget and credibility at risk.

**Acknowledge**:
"Proving impact is the number-one challenge for enablement — I hear it all the time."

**Respond**:
"Gong is built for that. We show whether reps actually use what they learned in customer conversations — methodology adherence, next steps, talk tracks — and tie it to deal velocity and win rates. So you're not just reporting completion; you're reporting 'when reps use X, win rate goes up Y%.' We have customers who've linked methodology to +7% win rates and next-steps tracking to deal velocity improvement. That's the story for your CRO and finance: enablement that's connected to revenue outcomes, not just effort."

**Proof Point**:
- Highspot: +7% win rates when utilizing methodology (Alicia Heagle, Manager Revenue Enablement)
- Culture Amp: deal velocity improvement with next-steps tracking (Simon Kirk, VP Revenue Enablement)
- "Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth"; "connect enablement to win rates, deal size, pipeline coverage"
- "Bridge the gap between learning and landing the deal"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"How do you measure enablement today — and what would you need to show your leadership to prove impact?"

### 2. "We already have an LMS / Highspot / Seismic"

**Why They Say This**:
They've invested in content and training delivery; they don't see why they need Gong for enablement.

**Acknowledge**:
"If you have an LMS or content platform, you've got the learning side covered."

**Respond**:
"The gap is the landing side: do reps actually do in deals what they learned in training? Gong doesn't replace your LMS; it shows execution and adoption — whether methodology, next steps, or talk tracks show up in real conversations. We integrate with Highspot, Seismic, and others so content and Gong data live together. So you get completion from your LMS and impact from Gong: win rate and deal velocity tied to behavior. That's how you go from support function to strategic driver. What would your CRO need to see to believe enablement is driving revenue?"

**Proof Point**:
- Integrations: Highspot, Seismic, Crayon, Showpad, Scribe, Lavender (enablement solution page)
- "Measure execution to guide next steps"; "know if reps are actually applying what they've learned"
- "Turn enablement programs into revenue"; "go from support function to strategic driver"
- Highspot +7% win rate; Culture Amp deal velocity

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When you roll out a new methodology, how do you know if reps are using it in customer conversations — or only in training?"

### 3. Budget: "Enablement budget is tight — we're seen as cost center"

**Why They Say This**:
Enablement is underfunded or seen as "training" not revenue driver; they have to justify every dollar.

**Acknowledge**:
"Enablement often has to fight for budget — and the 'cost center' label is frustrating."

**Respond**:
"The way to flip that is to tie enablement to revenue. Gong gives you the data: when reps use the methodology or behaviors you train on, win rate and deal velocity improve. So the story isn't 'we need budget for training'; it's 'we need investment in enablement that drives X% win rate and Y deal velocity — and here's the proof.' We have customers who've cut ramp in half and shown +7% win rates from methodology. That's a revenue story your CRO and finance can get behind. What would they need to see to treat enablement as a growth investment?"

**Proof Point**:
- Iron Mountain: onboarding times cut in half (Christine Canfield, VP SMB Inside Sales)
- Highspot: +7% win rates with methodology
- Culture Amp: deal velocity improvement with execution tracking
- "Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth"; "strategic growth partner"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would need to change for your CRO or finance to see enablement as a revenue driver, not a cost?"

### 4. "Managers don't have time to coach — how does Gong help?"

**Why They Say This**:
Managers are overwhelmed; coaching is inconsistent; enablement can't scale without manager buy-in.

**Acknowledge**:
"Managers are stretched — and coaching often falls to the bottom of the list."

**Respond**:
"Gong turns managers into enablement multipliers. We surface coaching moments automatically: messaging misses, stalled deals, key moments. So managers don't have to hunt for context; they get a clear view of where each rep needs help and what to reinforce. That makes 1:1s and deal reviews faster and more impactful. The AI does the heavy lifting so managers can coach where it counts. We've seen 'much more impactful 1:1s' and consistency across the team when leaders have that visibility. What would make your managers actually want to use this for coaching?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Turn managers into enablement multipliers"; "surface messaging misses, stalled deal behaviors, key coaching moments"
- DemandScience: "level of consistency we haven't had"; "much more impactful 1:1s for our leaders/reps" — Eric Choronzy
- "Quickly surface... so everyone can align on how to intervene and what to reinforce"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"How do managers today know where each rep needs coaching — and how much time do they spend gathering context vs. actually coaching?"

| Enablement budget tight | Frame as revenue driver with proof; win rate, ramp, velocity | Iron Mountain ramp; Highspot; "strategic growth partner" |
| Managers don't have time | Surface coaching moments; managers multiply enablement; less hunting | "Turn managers into enablement multipliers"; DemandScience 1:1s |
