# Enablement (Revenue Enablement)

## Role/Title
Revenue Enablement lead, VP Enablement, Head of Sales Enablement, or similar. Owns onboarding, coaching, and programs that improve seller effectiveness and tie training to outcomes.

## Responsibilities
- Deliver personalized training at scale; ramp reps faster and improve seller effectiveness
- Bridge the gap between learning and landing the deal; measure execution and adoption
- Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth; connect enablement to win rates, deal velocity, pipeline
- Turn managers into enablement multipliers; surface coaching moments and reinforce winning behaviors

## Company Profile
B2B companies with a dedicated enablement function; often mid-market to enterprise. Sales and sometimes CS enablement; may work with marketing on content and messaging.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Enablement seen as support function, not strategic; impact hard to prove beyond completion rates
- Gap between training and field execution; unclear what’s sticking and what’s slipping
- Long ramp times; difficulty scaling coaching and replicating top performers
- LMS and completion metrics don’t show impact on win rates or deal velocity

## Goals & Objectives
- Turn enablement programs into revenue; go from support function to strategic driver
- Accelerate onboarding, coaching, and skills development; cut ramp time (e.g. Iron Mountain: onboarding times cut in half)
- Measure execution to guide next steps; track adoption, skills gaps, methodology adherence
- Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth; link enablement to win rates and deal velocity (e.g. Culture Amp: deal velocity improvement; Highspot: +7% win rates with methodology)

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Revenue Graph + AI:** Visibility into how rep behavior and coaching efficacy impact the bottom line; ditch surface-level metrics for execution and adoption data.
- **Onboarding & coaching:** Ramp built from real customer conversations; pinpoint skill gaps, methodology adherence, personalized practice at scale; “Turn managers into enablement multipliers.”
- **Measurement:** Know if reps apply what they’ve learned; clear data on execution and adoption; tie programs to win rates, deal size, pipeline coverage.
- **Integrations:** Highspot, Seismic, Crayon, Showpad, Scribe, Lavender, etc., so enablement content and Gong calls live together.

## Buying Process
Often evaluated with sales leadership and RevOps. Enablement leaders care about linking training to outcomes, ramp time, and manager leverage. May involve L&D or HR for onboarding.

## Communication Preferences
Impact and proof: “Turn enablement programs into revenue”; “Prove what’s working”; “Bridge the gap between learning and landing the deal.” Case studies on ramp time, win rate, and deal velocity. Strategic partner narrative.
