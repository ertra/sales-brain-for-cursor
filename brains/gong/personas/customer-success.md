# Customer Success

## Role/Title
Customer Success Manager (CSM), Director/VP Customer Success, Chief Customer Officer. Own post-sale retention, renewal, and expansion.

## Responsibilities
- Retain and expand accounts; reduce churn and drive revenue across the customer lifecycle
- Identify risks early (health, engagement, feedback, pricing concerns) and act before renewal
- Ramp and align customer-facing teams; give full visibility into pipeline and customer interactions
- Collaborate with sales, proserv, and product with full account context (past convos, key moments, next steps)

## Company Profile
B2B companies with a dedicated CS function; often SaaS or subscription. Mid-market to enterprise; need to scale CS without losing context or missing expansion signals.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Chasing context; no single place for customer interactions and health signals
- Renewal and churn risk discovered too late; lack of forecast certainty for renewals/expansion
- New CSMs take too long to ramp (e.g. six months down to two with Gong — Vaishali Reed)
- Disconnect between learning and landing; enablement and outcomes not clearly linked

## Goals & Objectives
- Build customer relationships that retain and expand; turn post-sale data into action
- Drive revenue across the customer lifecycle; improve retention, account growth, and efficiency
- Unlock what’s really happening post-sale; turn customer signals into forecast certainty
- Turn every account into a growth opportunity; unite teams on customer-led growth

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Revenue Graph + visibility:** Full visibility into customer interactions and pipeline; know where you stand without chasing context; spot trends and value breakdown in the journey.
- **Forecast + signals:** Track renewal likelihood and churn risk early; engagement trends, feedback patterns, pricing concerns; act before it’s too late.
- **Engage + collaboration:** Strengthen collaboration from sales to proserv to product; full account story, past convos, key moments, next steps; follow up faster and deliver value.
- **Agents:** Reduce admin; ramp and align teams faster; “Turn CS into revenue success” — CRO visibility into renewal/expansion forecasts and customer risks.

## Buying Process
Often evaluated with sales and RevOps; CRO may sponsor. CS leaders care about visibility, ramp time, and proving impact (retention, expansion, NRR). Integrations with Gainsight, ChurnZero, etc. matter for existing stacks.

## Communication Preferences
Retention and expansion outcomes; “reduce churn,” “grow accounts,” “turn customer signals into forecast certainty.” Proof from CS leaders (e.g. onboarding time cut from six months to two; coaching and visibility). Customer-led growth and alignment with sales.
