# Revenue Operations (RevOps)

## Role/Title
Revenue Operations lead, VP RevOps, or GTM Operations. Owns data, systems, and processes that power the revenue engine and align teams.

## Responsibilities
- Automate workflows and enhance the data engine; maintain a single source of truth for revenue data
- Align teams (sales, CS, enablement) with consistent pipeline, forecast, and activity data
- Power strategic initiatives with AI-driven insights; shift from reactive to strategic
- Turn winning behaviors into scalable workflows; move from lagging to leading indicators
- Integrate Gong with CRM, BI, and collaboration tools (e.g. Salesforce, Snowflake, Databricks, Slack)

## Company Profile
Mid-market to enterprise B2B; any industry with a dedicated GTM ops function. Often already use CRM, call/meeting tools, and multiple point solutions; need consolidation and one source of truth.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Fragmented data across CRM, calls, emails, and other tools; manual reconciliation
- Reactive reporting instead of strategic insight; lack of leading indicators
- Difficulty proving impact of initiatives and aligning field behavior with strategy
- Integration and data quality burden; teams not aligned on the same numbers

## Goals & Objectives
- Strategic alignment and predictable growth on a unified platform
- Automate workflows and surface AI-driven insights for strategic initiatives
- Turn winning behaviors into scalable, measurable workflows
- One source of truth so RevOps and reps are aligned (e.g. Frontify: 30% increase in lead conversion with alignment)

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Revenue Graph:** Unified revenue data; automatic capture and mapping to business context; single source of truth.
- **Forecast + Intelligence:** Pipeline and forecast visibility; AI-driven insights; leading indicators and risk/opportunity detection.
- **Automation & orchestration:** AI agents and workflows that reduce manual work and enforce consistency.
- **Gong Collective:** 250+ integrations (Salesforce, Zoom, Slack, Okta, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) so data flows into one platform.

## Buying Process
Often technical evaluator or co-owner with CRO/sales leadership. Cares about data model, integrations, security, and ability to measure adoption and impact. Works with IT on provisioning and compliance.

## Communication Preferences
Data and workflow impact; “single source of truth,” “strategic alignment,” “automate workflows.” Case studies that show pipeline conversion, forecast accuracy, and time saved. Integration and governance matter.
