# Sales (Sales Teams, Leaders, SDRs/BDRs, AEs)

## Role/Title
Sales leaders (VP Sales, Director of Sales), Account Executives (AEs), SDRs/BDRs (Sales/Business Development Reps). Frontline sellers and their managers who own pipeline and quota.

## Responsibilities
- Hit targets and close deals; build pipeline and move opportunities to closed-won
- Coach and develop reps (leaders); execute on plays and methodology (reps)
- Forecast accurately and reduce surprises; replace admin work with selling time
- Turn outreach into outcomes; multi-thread, upsell, reengage before deals slip

## Company Profile
B2B sales orgs from SMB to enterprise; inside sales, field sales, or hybrid. Often already use CRM and some engagement/calling tools; need better visibility and less manual work.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Buried in admin work (summaries, emails, CRM updates); blind to the right buying signals
- Unclear what actually drives wins; guesswork in coaching and pipeline review
- Forecast surprises and deal risk identified too late
- Enablement efforts not turning into measurable outcomes; ramp time too long

## Goals & Objectives
- Hit targets with better data; move faster, coach smarter, fewer surprises
- Drive performance with contextual data; identify risk early and get every rep to closed-won
- Turn activity into qualified pipeline; ensure enablement turns into outcomes
- Forecast the number with confidence; push more deals forward with AI-backed insights

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Revenue Graph + Engage:** Real buyer signals and full account context; targeted talk tracks and actions; AI-generated summaries, emails, follow-ups so reps spend more time closing.
- **Forecast:** Pipeline and deal visibility; forecast risks and deal alerts (pricing, competition, buyer activity); configurable dashboards and ownership.
- **Agents:** Automate follow-ups, pipeline edits, and next steps; reduce admin so reps focus on selling.
- **Enablement linkage:** See what closes deals and what buyers need to hear; reinforce winning behaviors (e.g. SpotOn +16% win rate through productivity gains; Crayon forecasting case).

## Buying Process
Sales leaders are often champions or heavy influencers; AEs/SDRs are end users. Evaluation focuses on ease of use, time back for selling, and manager visibility. Proof from similar teams (e.g. call/meeting booked ratio, conversion rate) resonates.

## Communication Preferences
Productivity and outcomes: “Replace admin work with high-impact activities”; “Turn outreach into outcomes.” Quotes from sales leaders and reps (e.g. “Gong’s AI is mind-blowing”; “improve call/meeting booked ratio and opportunity conversion”). ROI and speed to value.
