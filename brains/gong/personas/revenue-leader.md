# Revenue Leader (CRO / Revenue Executive)

## Role/Title
Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), VP Revenue, or equivalent revenue executive. Owns the full revenue number and alignment of sales, customer success, enablement, and RevOps.

## Responsibilities
- Hit revenue goals every quarter; own forecast and pipeline accountability
- Align GTM teams (sales, CS, enablement, RevOps) to execute faster and reduce risk
- Drive predictable growth with clear visibility into forecast, pipeline, and strategy execution
- Close the gap between plan and performance; scale winning behaviors across the org
- Make faster, more accurate, data-driven decisions (e.g. Mike Wolff, CRO: “Gong has allowed me to make faster, more accurate, and more informed decisions.”)

## Company Profile
Enterprise or mid-market B2B companies with material revenue teams; technology, financial services, healthcare, or other industries running complex GTM motions. Often 5,000+ employee scale or high-growth; need for one source of truth across revenue.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Forecast surprises and lack of unbiased visibility into pipeline and execution
- GTM teams working in silos; inconsistent view of what’s working in the field
- Difficulty replicating winning behaviors and turning strategy into consistent execution
- Time spent on non-selling work and manual reporting instead of coaching and strategy
- Churn and renewal risk not visible until too late

## Goals & Objectives
- Predictable, repeatable revenue; hit the number every time
- Complete, unbiased visibility into forecast, pipeline, and strategy execution in one place
- Empower people and grow pipeline; scale what works and course-correct faster
- Build a revenue engine that lasts; align every team (sales, CS, enablement, RevOps) to hit the number

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Revenue Graph + Forecast:** Clear line of sight into forecast and pipeline; real-time signals across deals and renewals; objective, data-driven decisions.
- **Engage + Agents:** Reduce non-selling work; automate tasks and surface coaching moments; consistency and more impactful 1:1s (e.g. DemandScience).
- **Unified platform:** One place for sales, CS, enablement, RevOps so the whole GTM org is aligned; “It takes every team to hit the number.”

## Buying Process
Typically sponsor or final approver for revenue/GTM technology. Evaluates with RevOps, sales leadership, and sometimes CS/enablement. Looks for ROI (productivity, predictability, growth), security/compliance, and analyst recognition (e.g. Gartner, Forrester).

## Communication Preferences
Executive-level proof (e.g. “Gong has transformed our business”; “I couldn’t live without Gong now”); focus on predictable growth, visibility, and closing the plan–performance gap. Case studies and ROI; trust and security matter for scale.
