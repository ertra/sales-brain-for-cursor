## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Enablement Impact & Ramp |
| **Target Persona** | Enablement Leader, Sales Leader |
| **Target Company** | B2B with enablement function; ramp or win rate pressure |
| **Products** | Gong platform (execution, adoption, methodology tracking), Revenue Graph |
| **Trigger Event** | "Prove enablement ROI"; ramp time pressure; new enablement or sales leader |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- "We need to prove enablement drives revenue"
- Ramp time or win rate under pressure
- New enablement or sales leader
- Budget review: "what's the ROI of enablement?"
- Evaluation of LMS, Highspot, Seismic — and need to show "landing" not just "learning"

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Enablement measured by completion only; can't tie to win rate or deal velocity
- Long ramp times; managers overwhelmed with coaching
- Desire to "go from support function to strategic driver"

## The Play

### Objective
Win on enablement by showing Gong **connects training to outcomes**: execution and adoption data, methodology tied to win rate and deal velocity, and faster ramp with real conversation data.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth — connect enablement to win rates, deal velocity, and pipeline. Cut ramp in half and turn managers into enablement multipliers."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify enablement and sales leadership; current LMS/content tools
- Understand how they measure enablement today (completion vs. outcomes)
- Ramp time and win rate baselines if available

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How do you measure enablement today — and how do you tie it to win rates, deal velocity, or pipeline?
2. When you roll out a new methodology or program, how do you know if reps are actually using it in customer conversations?
3. How long does it take a new rep to ramp to full productivity — and what would need to change to cut that in half?
4. Do managers have a clear view of where each rep needs coaching without chasing context?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Execution and adoption** — are reps using methodology and best practices in deals?
2. **Methodology tracking** — next steps, discovery, talk tracks; tie to deal velocity and win rate
3. **Onboarding** — how new reps use real conversation data to ramp
4. **Manager view** — coaching moments, messaging gaps, "turn managers into enablement multipliers"

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case studies**: Iron Mountain (onboarding cut in half); Highspot (+7% win rates with methodology); Culture Amp (deal velocity with next-steps tracking)
- **Objection handling**: [Enablement Objections](../objections/enablement-objections.md), [Common](../objections/common-objections.md)

## Key Messaging
- "Cut onboarding in half" (Iron Mountain); "+7% win rates with methodology" (Highspot)
- "Prove what's working — connect enablement to win rates and deal velocity"
- "Turn managers into enablement multipliers — surface coaching moments so everyone can reinforce what works"
