# Sales Play: GTM Alignment on One Platform

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | GTM Alignment on One Platform |
| **Target Persona** | Revenue Leader (CRO), RevOps |
| **Target Company** | Mid-market to enterprise; sales, CS, enablement, RevOps; tool sprawl or silos |
| **Products** | Gong Revenue AI OS (Revenue Graph, Forecast, Engage, Agents, Collective) |
| **Trigger Event** | "One source of truth" mandate; consolidation; reorg; missed quarter attributed to misalignment |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion / Competitive (vs. Salesloft, point tools) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- New CRO or "we need one source of truth"
- Tool consolidation or cost initiative
- Reorg that combines sales and CS or GTM
- M&A or new product line requiring unified GTM
- Multiple point tools (CI, engagement, forecast, CS) and desire to consolidate

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Sales, CS, enablement, RevOps on different tools and data
- Handoff and context issues (sales to CS, etc.)
- "Who owns the number?" or multiple forecast views

## The Play

### Objective
Win on platform and alignment by positioning Gong as **one data layer** (Revenue Graph) and one OS for sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps — so "it takes every team to hit the number" on the same data.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"It takes every team to hit the number. Align sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps on one platform — one source of truth for every revenue interaction."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Map GTM structure: sales, CS, enablement, RevOps; who uses which tools
- Identify consolidation or "one platform" initiatives
- Check for Salesloft, Outreach, or multiple point tools

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How many places do sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps go to get pipeline, forecast, and activity — and do they match?
2. When you roll out a new play or enablement program, how do you know if it's actually being used and driving results?
3. What would change if every GTM team had the same view of the number and the same context on every account?
4. How smooth are handoffs (e.g. sales to CS) — and where does context get lost?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Revenue Graph** — one data layer for every interaction and every team
2. **Forecast & pipeline** — same view for sales, CS, RevOps
3. **Engage & context** — full account story for sales and CS; handoffs
4. **Collective** — CRM and tools feed one platform; 250+ integrations

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case study**: Frontify (30% lead conversion with alignment; consolidation as main driver)
- **Proof**: "It takes every team to hit the number"; DemandScience (consistency, impactful 1:1s)
- **Objection handling**: [RevOps Objections](../objections/revenue-operations-objections.md), [Common](../objections/common-objections.md) (consolidation)

## Key Messaging
- "30% lead conversion when RevOps and reps aligned on one platform" (Frontify)
- "One source of truth; no more silos or multiple versions of the forecast"
- "Consolidation has been the main driver — one platform where you can do everything"
