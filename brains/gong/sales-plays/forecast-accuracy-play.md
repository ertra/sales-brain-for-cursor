# Sales Play: Forecast Accuracy & Pipeline Visibility

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Forecast Accuracy & Pipeline Visibility |
| **Target Persona** | Revenue Leader (CRO), RevOps, Sales Leader |
| **Target Company** | Mid-market to enterprise; complex GTM; forecast-critical |
| **Products** | Gong Forecast, Gong Revenue Graph |
| **Trigger Event** | Missed quarter; board/forecast scrutiny; "one source of truth" mandate |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion / Competitive (vs. Clari, spreadsheets, CRM-only) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Missed quarterly forecast or board ask for "better visibility"
- New CRO or VP Sales; "we need one source of truth for the number"
- Evaluation of forecast tools (Clari, CRM-native, spreadsheets)
- Churn or renewal risk discovered too late

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Multiple "versions of the truth" for pipeline and forecast
- Forecast based mainly on CRM and rep input, not conversation data
- RevOps or finance leading evaluation for forecast accuracy
- Recent reorg or new revenue leadership

## The Play

### Objective
Win on forecast and pipeline visibility by positioning Gong as the only solution that grounds the number in **every customer interaction** (Revenue Graph), not just CRM and process.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Get a clear line of sight into your forecast, pipeline, and strategy execution — all in one place, grounded in what was actually said and done in every call and email."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify who owns the number (CRO, RevOps, VP Sales, Finance)
- Understand current forecast process: where does the number come from? (CRM, spreadsheets, gut feel)
- Check for competitive footprint (Clari, CRM-only, manual)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How do you get to your number today — and how often does actual result match the forecast?
2. Where does your forecast get its deal and pipeline signals — from rep input and CRM, or from conversation and engagement data?
3. When do you typically find out a deal or renewal is at risk?
4. Do reps and leaders use the same pipeline and forecast data RevOps maintains?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Revenue Graph** — every interaction captured and connected to deals and accounts
2. **Forecast** — pipeline and forecast views; deal alerts (pricing, competition, buyer activity); paths to target
3. **Signals** — how deal and renewal risk surface from conversation, not just CRM
4. **Single source of truth** — one place for leadership and RevOps

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case study**: Crayon (ownership, accountability, transparency, "more time to deals that need our attention")
- **Proof**: Gartner Leader Revenue Action Orchestration; "faster, more accurate decisions" (CRO)
- **Objection handling**: [Revenue Leader Objections](../objections/revenue-leader-objections.md), [Common](../objections/common-objections.md)

## Key Messaging
- "One place for your number, pipeline, and execution — grounded in real activity"
- "Real-time signals across deals and renewals so you act before surprises"
- "Unbiased visibility; ownership and accountability for every team member"
