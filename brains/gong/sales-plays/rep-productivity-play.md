# Sales Play: Rep Productivity & Scale Without Headcount

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Rep Productivity & Scale Without Headcount |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Leader, Revenue Leader, RevOps |
| **Target Company** | B2B sales orgs; inside/field; productivity and pipeline pressure |
| **Products** | Gong Revenue Graph, Gong Agents, Gong Engage |
| **Trigger Event** | Need more pipeline without proportional hire; "reps buried in admin"; ramp or win rate pressure |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Expansion / Competitive (vs. Outreach, Salesloft engagement) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- "We need more pipeline but can't add headcount"
- Rep productivity or adoption concerns; "reps won't use another tool"
- Evaluation of sales engagement or conversation intelligence
- Board or CRO ask for productivity gains

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Reps spending significant time on notes, follow-up, CRM updates
- Sales engagement or CI evaluation (Outreach, Salesloft, etc.)
- Win rate or conversion under pressure; ramp time long

## The Play

### Objective
Win on productivity and scale by showing that Gong **gives time back** (auto-capture, AI summaries, agents) and powers engagement with full context (Revenue Graph), so reps sell more and managers coach better.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Replace admin work with high-impact activities — AI that generates summaries, suggests follow-ups, and drafts emails. Give reps more time to close; give managers visibility without the status meeting."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify sales leader and RevOps; understand rep count and current tools (CRM, engagement, CI)
- Quantify "time on admin" if possible (notes, follow-up, CRM)
- Check for Outreach/Salesloft/other engagement or CI

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How much time do reps spend on call notes, follow-ups, and CRM updates vs. actual selling?
2. When managers do pipeline or deal reviews, where does the real context come from?
3. What would it mean if every rep had 5–10 more hours per week for selling?
4. How do you follow up after calls or meetings — and how often do next steps slip?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Auto-capture & Revenue Graph** — every interaction connected to deals and accounts; no manual entry
2. **Agents** — follow-up suggestions, pipeline updates, summary generation
3. **Engage** — full account context, next best actions, personalized outreach
4. **Manager view** — pipeline and deal visibility without asking reps to re-report

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case study**: Uber for Business (6,700 hours saved; 32% buyer response lift); EdgePetrol (300% pipeline feed)
- **Proof**: Rep and leader quotes ("productivity incredible"; "I couldn't live without Gong now")
- **Objection handling**: [Sales Objections](../objections/sales-objections.md), [Common](../objections/common-objections.md)

## Key Messaging
- "6,700 hours saved; 32% lift in buyer response — productivity and outcomes at scale"
- "Replace admin work with high-impact activities"
- "Turn outreach into outcomes" with full context from every interaction
