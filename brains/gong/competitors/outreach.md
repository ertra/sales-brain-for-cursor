# Competitor: Outreach

## Overview
Outreach is a sales execution platform focused on sales engagement (sequences, cadences, pipeline execution), with conversation intelligence and pipeline tools. They compete with Gong where deals are evaluation is “engagement-first” or “execution-first” vs. “intelligence-first.” Gong differentiates on the Revenue Graph, conversation-backed forecast, and Revenue AI OS (one data layer powering engagement, forecast, and risk).

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.outreach.io
- **Founded**: 2014
- **Headquarters**: Seattle, Washington
- **Company Size**: 1,000+ employees
- **Funding/Revenue**: Significant venture funding; major player in sales engagement
- **Key Customers**: Enterprise B2B sales teams; sales development and pipeline execution focus

## Product Overview
Outreach provides pipeline execution and sales engagement: sequences, cadences, multi-channel outreach, call/meeting integration, and pipeline and forecasting capabilities. Conversation intelligence and deal intelligence have been added to compete with revenue intelligence vendors.

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Sequences / Cadences | Multi-channel sales engagement, automation | Gong Engage |
| Conversation intelligence | Call/meeting capture, transcription, insights | Gong Revenue Graph, Intelligence |
| Pipeline / Deal execution | Pipeline visibility, deal management | Gong Forecast, pipeline |
| Forecasting | Revenue forecast | Gong Forecast |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: Sales execution platform (or similar)
- **Key Message**: Execute on pipeline; run sequences and engagement at scale; improve pipeline conversion
- **Target Market**: Sales and SDR/BDR teams; pipeline and execution focus

## Strengths
- Long-standing leader in sales engagement and sequences; large installed base
- Strong pipeline execution narrative; “run your pipeline” messaging
- Mature sequencing and automation; adoption and familiarity
- Conversation intelligence and deal tools added to round out platform

## Weaknesses
- Intelligence layer can be perceived as added to engagement, not the core; Gong’s core is the revenue data layer
- Single “Revenue Graph” of every interaction (calls, email, meetings) as the foundation is Gong’s architectural story; Outreach built engagement-first
- Forecast and deal risk from conversation signals (what was said, not just activity) is a Gong strength to emphasize
- Gartner/Forrester positioning in “Revenue Action Orchestration” and “Revenue AI” favors Gong in analyst-led deals

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Gong | Outreach | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| Revenue Graph (all interactions, one graph) | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial | Gong differentiator; single data layer |
| Sales engagement / sequences | ✅ Engage | ✅ Strong | Outreach mature; Gong ties to Revenue Graph |
| Conversation intelligence | ✅ Core | ✅ | Gong: data is the product; Outreach: add-on to engagement |
| Forecast (conversation-backed) | ✅ | ✅ | Gong: fed by Revenue Graph and buyer signals |
| Deal risk from conversation signals | ✅ | ⚠️ | Gong strength: pricing, competition, sentiment from calls |
| Revenue AI OS / platform narrative | ✅ | ⚠️ | Gong: Gartner Leader; Revenue AI OS positioning |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Gong)
- Buyer wants “revenue intelligence” or “revenue AI” as the strategic bet; data and insight first, then engagement
- Forecast accuracy and deal risk must be grounded in what was said in conversations, not just activity
- CRO/RevOps want one source of truth for every interaction (Revenue Graph) and apps on top
- Analyst-driven evaluations (Gartner, Forrester) where Gong’s Revenue Action Orchestration and Revenue AI OS rank highly
- Already have or prefer a dedicated engagement tool; looking for best-in-class intelligence and forecast

### When They Win (Outreach)
- Primary driver is “we need better sequences and pipeline execution”; engagement maturity is the key criterion
- Strong Outreach champion and existing rollout
- Evaluation is led by sales ops/engagement team with less focus on intelligence and forecast depth

### Key Differentiators (Gong Advantages)
1. **Revenue Graph**: One living network of every revenue interaction; engagement and forecast are built on that data, not layered on top of an engagement engine.
2. **Conversation-backed forecast and risk**: Deal and forecast signals from what was said in calls and emails; not just activity and CRM.
3. **Revenue AI OS**: Position as the AI operating system for revenue (Gartner Leader); Outreach is execution platform with intelligence added.
4. **Unified GTM**: Sales, CS, enablement, RevOps on one data layer; Outreach traditionally sales/SDR-focused.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "We have conversation intelligence" | Yes; often part of execution platform | Gong’s product is the revenue data layer; intelligence isn’t an add-on, it’s the core that powers engagement and forecast. |
| "Best for pipeline execution" | Strong in sequences and execution | Execution is better when it’s informed by the richest interaction data — that’s the Revenue Graph. |
| "One platform" | Engagement-centric platform with intelligence | Gong: one graph of every interaction, then one OS (Engage, Forecast, Agents) on top. |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Outreach
"Outreach is strong in sales engagement and pipeline execution. The decision often comes down to whether you want an execution platform that added intelligence, or an intelligence platform that powers execution — one graph of every customer interaction that drives your forecast, risk, and engagement. Gong is built the latter way. What’s driving your evaluation more: sequencing and execution, or forecast accuracy and deal risk from conversation data?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Outreach
1. Lead with Revenue Graph and conversation-backed forecast and deal risk.
2. Show how engagement (Gong Engage) is informed by full context from every interaction, not just touch counts.
3. Use Gartner/Forrester and “Revenue AI OS” to support platform and strategic value.
4. If they’re Outreach-heavy, position Gong as the intelligence and forecast layer that can sit alongside or eventually consolidate; lead with value, not “rip and replace.”

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Is your forecast today based mainly on CRM and activity, or on what’s actually being said in calls and emails?" (Gong: conversation-backed.)
2. "When you think ‘one source of truth,’ do you mean one workflow tool or one data layer that captures every revenue interaction?" (Gong: data layer.)
3. "How does your deal risk and pipeline health get updated — from rep input and activity, or automatically from conversation content?" (Gong: from Revenue Graph.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Gong | Outreach |
|--|------|----------|
| Model | Per seat / platform | Per seat / platform |
| Key Differences | Premium on intelligence and platform; Revenue Graph and AI OS | Strong on engagement and execution; broad seat adoption |

## Recent News & Updates
- Outreach continues to expand conversation and pipeline capabilities; competitive overlap with Gong in revenue intelligence and engagement.
- Some accounts evaluate both; displacement in both directions depending on buyer priority (intelligence vs. execution).
