# Competitor: Clari

## Overview
Clari is a revenue platform focused on revenue operations, forecasting, and pipeline management. They emphasize forecast accuracy, pipeline discipline, and RevOps efficiency. Gong competes where the buyer wants forecast and pipeline grounded in **conversation and interaction data** (Revenue Graph) and a **Revenue AI OS** that includes engagement and intelligence, not just forecast and pipeline tools. Clari is strong in forecast workflow and RevOps; Gong is strong in conversation-backed forecast and unified revenue data.

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.clari.com
- **Founded**: 2012
- **Headquarters**: Sunnyvale, California
- **Company Size**: 500+ employees
- **Funding/Revenue**: Significant funding; major player in revenue operations and forecasting
- **Key Customers**: RevOps and finance-led orgs; forecast and pipeline focus

## Product Overview
Clari provides revenue pipeline and forecast management: forecast workflows, pipeline analytics, deal and commit tracking, and RevOps-focused dashboards. Positioned for “revenue operations” and “forecast accuracy.” Some overlap with Gong on forecast and pipeline; less emphasis on conversation intelligence as the data foundation.

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Forecast | Forecast management, commit, pipeline | Gong Forecast |
| Pipeline | Pipeline visibility, deal management | Gong Forecast, Revenue Graph pipeline view |
| Revenue operations | RevOps workflows, analytics | Gong platform (RevOps persona) |
| (Conversation / intelligence) | Limited or partner-led | Gong Revenue Graph, Intelligence |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: Revenue platform (or similar)
- **Key Message**: Forecast accuracy; pipeline discipline; RevOps as the system of record for the number
- **Target Market**: RevOps, finance, CRO; forecast and pipeline accountability

## Strengths
- Strong RevOps and forecast workflow narrative; “own the number” messaging
- Mature forecast and pipeline management; commit and roll-up workflows
- Good fit when the buyer is RevOps/finance-led and forecast process is the priority
- Recognized brand in revenue operations and forecasting

## Weaknesses
- Forecast and pipeline are typically fed by CRM and manual/process input; not a “Revenue Graph” of every interaction
- Limited conversation intelligence as the core data layer; Gong’s differentiator is conversation-backed forecast and deal risk
- No native engagement (sequences, cadences) like Gong Engage; different scope
- “Revenue AI OS” and Gartner Revenue Action Orchestration positioning favor Gong where analysts are involved

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Gong | Clari | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|-------|
| Revenue Graph (every interaction) | ✅ | ❌ | Gong: single data layer from calls, email, meetings |
| Forecast (conversation-backed) | ✅ | ⚠️ Process-backed | Gong: signals from what was said; Clari: workflow and CRM |
| Deal risk from conversation | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | Gong: pricing, competition, sentiment from calls/emails |
| Pipeline management | ✅ | ✅ | Both; Gong ties to Revenue Graph |
| RevOps workflow (commit, roll-up) | ✅ | ✅ Strong | Clari strong in process; Gong in data and insight |
| Sales engagement | ✅ Engage | ❌ | Gong has full engagement; Clari typically not |
| Conversation intelligence | ✅ Core | ⚠️ Limited/partner | Gong’s product is the data layer |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Gong)
- Buyer wants forecast and pipeline grounded in **what was said and done** in customer interactions, not just CRM and commit process
- CRO/RevOps want one source of truth that includes every call, meeting, and email (Revenue Graph), then forecast and engagement on top
- Sales engagement and conversation intelligence are in scope alongside forecast
- “Revenue AI” or “Revenue AI OS” resonates; Gartner/Forrester and analyst-led evaluations
- Deal risk and forecast accuracy from conversation signals (pricing, competition, engagement) are key requirements

### When They Win (Clari)
- Primary driver is forecast **process** (commit, roll-up, discipline) and RevOps workflow; less focus on conversation data
- Strong Clari champion; existing forecast and pipeline process built on Clari
- Buyer is RevOps/finance-led and “we already have conversation intelligence” or don’t prioritize it
- Evaluation is “forecast tool” not “revenue intelligence platform”

### Key Differentiators (Gong Advantages)
1. **Conversation-backed forecast**: Forecast and deal risk powered by Revenue Graph (every interaction), not just CRM and manual input; “what was said” drives the number.
2. **Revenue Graph**: One living network of revenue data; Clari is forecast/pipeline workflow, not a graph of all interactions.
3. **Full Revenue AI OS**: Engage, Forecast, Agents, Collective — not just forecast and pipeline; Clari is narrow to RevOps/forecast.
4. **Deal risk from conversation**: Pricing, competition, sentiment, and engagement from calls and emails; Clari typically process and CRM-driven.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Best-in-class forecast accuracy" | Strong on process and workflow | Accuracy is better when the forecast is fed by every customer interaction — that’s the Revenue Graph. |
| "Revenue platform" | Focused on forecast and pipeline workflow | Gong is a Revenue AI OS: one data layer (Revenue Graph) plus engagement, forecast, and agents. |
| "RevOps system of record" | True for forecast process | Gong is the system of record for **revenue data** (every interaction); then forecast and RevOps run on that. |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Clari
"Clari is strong in forecast process and RevOps workflow. The key question is whether you want your number to come from process and CRM, or from the actual customer interactions — every call, meeting, and email — in one Revenue Graph. Gong’s forecast is conversation-backed: deal risk and pipeline health come from what was said, not just what’s in the CRM. What matters more for you: process and roll-up, or data from the field?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Clari
1. Lead with Revenue Graph and conversation-backed forecast and deal risk.
2. Show how deal alerts and pipeline health use conversation signals (pricing, competition, engagement).
3. Position full Revenue AI OS (Engage, Forecast, Agents) vs. forecast/pipeline tool.
4. Use Gartner Revenue Action Orchestration and “Revenue AI OS” if the buyer cares about platform and strategy.
5. If they’re process-focused, acknowledge Clari’s strength; position Gong as “same outcome — accurate forecast — but with the richest data source: every interaction.”

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Where does your forecast get its deal and pipeline signals today — from CRM and rep input, or from what’s actually said in calls and emails?" (Gong: conversation-backed.)
2. "When a deal is at risk, how do you find out — from the rep updating the CRM, or from conversation and engagement signals?" (Gong: automatic from Revenue Graph.)
3. "Do you want a forecast tool that sits on top of your process, or a revenue data layer that captures every interaction and then powers forecast, engagement, and risk?" (Gong: data layer.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Gong | Clari |
|--|------|-------|
| Model | Per seat / platform | Per seat / platform |
| Key Differences | Revenue Graph + full OS (engagement, forecast, agents); conversation-backed | Forecast and pipeline workflow; process and CRM-centric |

## Recent News & Updates
- Clari continues to focus on revenue operations and forecast; some expansion into adjacent areas.
- Competitive overlap on forecast and pipeline; Gong wins on conversation-backed data and full Revenue AI OS when that’s the buyer priority.
