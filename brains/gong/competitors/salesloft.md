# Competitor: Salesloft

## Overview
Salesloft positions as a Revenue Orchestration Platform with sales engagement (Cadence), conversation intelligence (Conversations), deal management (Deals), forecasting (Forecast), and website chat (Drift). They emphasize unified workflow and “one platform” for revenue teams. Gong competes on revenue intelligence depth, Revenue Graph as the data foundation, and positioning as the Revenue AI OS (conversation and interaction data at the core, not engagement-first).

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.salesloft.com (or salesloft.com)
- **Founded**: 2011
- **Headquarters**: Atlanta, Georgia
- **Company Size**: 1,000+ employees
- **Funding/Revenue**: Acquired by Vista Equity Partners; private
- **Key Customers**: Large B2B sales orgs; positioned for revenue orchestration

## Product Overview
Salesloft offers Cadence (sales engagement/sequencing), Conversations (call and meeting intelligence), Deals, Forecast, and Drift (website chat). Positioned as a single platform for the full revenue workflow.

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Cadence | Sales engagement, sequences, multi-channel | Gong Engage |
| Conversations | Call recording, transcription, analytics | Gong Revenue Graph, Intelligence |
| Deals | Deal and pipeline management | Gong Forecast, pipeline visibility |
| Forecast | Revenue forecasting | Gong Forecast |
| Drift | Website chat and conversion | Gong has no direct equivalent |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: Revenue Orchestration Platform (or similar)
- **Key Message**: Unified workflow — engagement, conversations, deals, forecast in one platform
- **Target Market**: B2B revenue teams wanting “one platform” and mature sales engagement

## Strengths
- Mature sales engagement (Cadence) with long history and scale (e.g. 100M+ activities cited)
- Unified narrative: one vendor for engagement, calls, deals, forecast
- Drift (website chat) — no Gong equivalent
- Strong sales engagement depth (sequences, cadences, multi-channel)
- Many AI agents (25+) for research and automation in their narrative

## Weaknesses
- Conversation/revenue intelligence may be positioned as one module among many; Gong’s core is the Revenue Graph and interaction data
- “Unified” can mean many products; data foundation (single graph of every interaction) is Gong’s differentiator
- Forecast and deal insight depth vs. Gong’s conversation-backed pipeline and signals (positioning)
- Premium positioning on both sides; total cost and scope differ by deal

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Gong | Salesloft | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| Conversation / revenue intelligence | ✅ Core (Revenue Graph) | ✅ Conversations | Gong: data layer is the product; every interaction connected |
| Sales engagement | ✅ Engage | ✅ Strong (Cadence) | Salesloft more mature in pure sequencing; Gong ties engagement to Revenue Graph |
| Revenue Graph (single data layer) | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial | Gong: one graph of all interactions; core differentiator |
| Forecasting (conversation-backed) | ✅ | ✅ | Gong: forecast fed by Revenue Graph and buyer signals |
| Website chat | ❌ | ✅ Drift | Salesloft unique; Gong no direct equivalent |
| AI agents (revenue-specific) | ✅ | ✅ | Both invest; Gong agents built on Revenue Graph |
| Unified workflow narrative | ✅ Revenue AI OS | ✅ Revenue Orchestration | Different architecture: data-first (Gong) vs. workflow-first (Salesloft) |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Gong)
- Revenue intelligence and conversation data are the strategic priority; “one source of truth” means one graph of every interaction
- Forecast and pipeline must be grounded in real buyer/customer activity, not just CRM and engagement events
- CRO/RevOps want a revenue AI OS with data at the center (Revenue Graph), then apps on top
- Deep call/meeting/email analytics and deal risk from conversation signals matter more than sequencing maturity
- Customer already has or prefers best-in-class engagement elsewhere and wants best-in-class intelligence

### When They Win (Salesloft)
- Sales engagement (cadences, sequences) is the primary driver and they want the most mature offering
- Website chat (Drift) is a must-have
- “One vendor” is more important than “one data layer”; workflow unification over data unification
- Strong Salesloft champion; existing Cadence/Drift investment

### Key Differentiators (Gong Advantages)
1. **Revenue Graph as the foundation**: One living network of every revenue interaction; engagement and forecast are apps on top of that data, not separate modules.
2. **Conversation-backed forecast and pipeline**: Deal risk and forecast grounded in what was said and done in calls/meetings/email, not just CRM and activity logs.
3. **Revenue AI OS positioning**: Gartner Leader in Revenue Action Orchestration; “Ability to Execute” and “Completeness of Vision” — position as the AI OS for revenue, not engagement-plus-intelligence.
4. **Depth of intelligence**: Core built for conversation and interaction analysis; Salesloft built for engagement first, then added intelligence.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Unified revenue platform" | Multiple products (Cadence, Conversations, Deals, Forecast, Drift) | Gong is one Revenue Graph plus one OS; data unity, then workflow. |
| "Cadence is more mature than Gong Engage" | True for pure sequencing/cadence depth | Engage is built on the Revenue Graph — every touch is connected to deals and context; different architecture. |
| "We have conversation intelligence too" | They do; often one module in a suite | Gong’s product is the revenue data layer; intelligence isn’t bolted on, it’s the core. |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Salesloft
"Salesloft is strong in sales engagement and has a good story on one platform. The key question is whether you want workflow unification — one vendor for cadences, calls, deals — or data unification: one graph of every customer interaction that powers forecast, engagement, and risk. Gong is built around the Revenue Graph so your number and your pipeline are grounded in what actually happened in conversations. What’s driving your evaluation — engagement maturity or intelligence and forecast accuracy?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Salesloft
1. Lead with Revenue Graph and conversation-backed forecast; show deal risk and signals from calls/meetings.
2. Position Revenue AI OS vs. revenue orchestration: data-first (Gong) vs. workflow-first (Salesloft).
3. If they need Drift, acknowledge it; position Gong for intelligence and forecast, and discuss how they use chat today.
4. Use Gartner/Forrester and “Revenue Action Orchestration” to support Gong’s platform story.
5. Emphasize total value: predictability and productivity from one data layer, not just feature count.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Where does your forecast and deal risk actually come from — CRM fields and activity, or what was said in calls and emails?" (Gong: conversation-backed.)
2. "Do you want one vendor for workflows, or one source of truth for every revenue interaction?" (Gong: data layer.)
3. "How do you get from 'we have conversation intelligence' to 'we have one graph of every interaction powering forecast and engagement'?" (Gong’s architecture.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Gong | Salesloft |
|--|------|-----------|
| Model | Per seat / platform | Per seat / platform |
| Perception | Premium; value in intelligence and platform | Value in breadth (engagement + conversations + deals + forecast + Drift) |
| Key Differences | Revenue Graph and AI OS; conversation-backed everything | Mature engagement and chat; unified workflow narrative |

## Recent News & Updates
- Salesloft under Vista; continued focus on revenue orchestration and platform.
- Competitive displacement in both directions; some accounts use both (e.g. Gong for intelligence, Salesloft for engagement) before consolidating.
