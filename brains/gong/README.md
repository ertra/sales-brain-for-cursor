## What Is This?

## Gong in One Sentence

Gong is the **Revenue AI OS** that combines a rich revenue data graph, AI agents, and GTM apps (Engage, Forecast, Collective) to improve pipeline visibility, forecast quality, and team execution.

## Proof Points to Remember

| Customer | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Frontify** | **30%** lead conversion increase; improved alignment and visibility |
| **Uber for Business** | **6,700 hours** saved; **32%** lift in buyer response rates |
| **Iron Mountain** | Onboarding/ramp time cut in half |
| **RTA** | Sales doubled; forecast accuracy tripled |
| **Crayon** | Better forecast ownership, transparency, and accountability |

## Key Differentiators

1. **Revenue Graph + multimodal signals** — Captures and connects interactions across GTM.
2. **AI agents + purpose-built apps** — Forecasting, engagement, enablement, and workflow execution in one system.
3. **Broad GTM coverage** — Sales, RevOps, enablement, and CS use the same data model.
4. **Enterprise credibility** — Strong analyst positioning and large enterprise adoption.
