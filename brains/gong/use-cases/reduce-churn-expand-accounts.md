# Use Case: Reduce Churn and Expand Accounts

## Overview
Customer success teams need to see renewal and churn risk early — and act before it's too late — while finding expansion signals (new stakeholders, use cases) that are often missed. This use case addresses "chasing context," late discovery of risk, and the need for one place to see what's really happening post-sale.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS or subscription-heavy; mid-market to enterprise
- **Size**: Dedicated CS function; often 10+ CSMs to hundreds; renewal and expansion are key to NRR/ARR
- **Characteristics**: Already use CRM and possibly CS tools; need better visibility into customer interactions and health

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Customer Success Leader (Director/VP CS, CCO); CSMs as end users
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales (handoff, expansion), RevOps (renewal forecast), Product (feedback signals)

### Trigger Event
Churn spike or key logo at risk; new CS leadership; "we need better visibility and predictability"; scaling CS team; reorg that puts CS and sales under one leader (alignment mandate)

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Renewal and churn risk surface late — often when the customer is already disengaged or in procurement
- CSMs chase context across CRM, email, and other tools; no single view of customer interactions
- New CSMs take months to ramp (e.g. six months) because knowledge is in people's heads or scattered
- Sales and CS don't share the same account story; handoffs are incomplete; expansion signals get missed

### Desired State (After)
- Real-time signals for renewal likelihood and churn risk (engagement, feedback, pricing concerns); act before it's too late
- Full visibility into customer interactions and pipeline so CSMs know where they stand without chasing context
- Faster CSM ramp with centralized account context and less admin
- Sales and CS aligned on the same account story; expansion opportunities identified and acted on

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Gong Revenue Graph (post-sale visibility, account context), Gong Forecast (renewal and risk signals)
- **Supporting**: Gong Engage (collaboration, handoffs, full account story), Agents (reduce admin so CSMs focus on customers)

### Solution Overview
Revenue Graph captures every customer interaction post-sale and connects it to accounts; CS and sales see the same context (past convos, key moments, next steps). Forecast and signals surface renewal likelihood and churn risk early so teams can intervene. Engage and collaboration features keep sales, CS, and product aligned. Result: act on risk early, ramp CSMs faster, and turn every account into a growth opportunity.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Gong and ensure post-sale interactions (calls, meetings, email) are captured and mapped to accounts in Revenue Graph
2. Configure renewal and risk signals in Forecast; train CS leaders and CSMs on using signals for prioritization and action
3. Use Gong for handoffs and shared account context so sales and CS work from one story
4. Onboard new CSMs with Gong as the source of account and customer context; reduce ramp time

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| CSM ramp time | e.g. six months down to ~2 months (Vaishali Reed, Director Global CS & Programs Operations) |
| When renewal risk is visible | Late in cycle → early signals (engagement, feedback, pricing) |
| Sales–CS handoff and expansion | Incomplete → one account story; expansion signals surfaced |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Act on churn and renewal risk before it's too late
- "Know where you stand" without chasing context
- Prove how CS drives revenue (renewal forecast, expansion); "Turn CS into revenue success"
- Better collaboration and customer outcomes (e.g. Jeffrey Coleman, CCO: "coach, support, and celebrate"; "improving outcomes for our team and for our clients")

## Proof Points

### Customer Example
- **Company**: (Vaishali Reed’s org — Director of Global Customer Success & Programs Operations)
- **Challenge**: Long CSM onboarding (six months); need to ramp new CSMs faster and keep teams aligned
- **Solution**: Gong for centralized account context and visibility; CSMs use Gong for customer interactions and pipeline
- **Results**: Onboarding time reduced from six months to just over two months
- **Quote**: "Our onboarding time was shrinking from six months to five to four. Today I'm able to onboard a brand new CSM within just over two months down from six months pre-Gong." — Vaishali Reed, Director of Global Customer Success & Programs Operations

### Data Points
- Eric Stoddard (Head of Global Sales & CS Enablement): insights from customer interactions at scale → actions that improve pipeline and revenue decisions
- Jeffrey Coleman (CCO): "With Gong our managers are able to see what's really happening. We can coach, support, and celebrate the success of our team members, improving outcomes for our team and for our clients."

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. When do you typically know a renewal is at risk — and what signals do you wish you had earlier?
2. Where do CSMs get the full picture of an account today — and how long does it take a new CSM to feel fully up to speed?
3. How smooth is the handoff from sales to CS — and do both teams use the same view of the account?
4. How much time do CSMs spend finding context vs. actually engaging customers?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Revenue Graph: every customer interaction post-sale connected to accounts
- Forecast and signals: renewal likelihood, churn risk (engagement, feedback, pricing)
- Full account story: past convos, key moments, next steps for sales and CS
- Ramp: how new CSMs use Gong for account context and prioritization

### Key Talking Points
- "Turn customer signals into forecast certainty — track renewal likelihood and churn risk early"
- "Stop chasing context — full visibility into customer interactions and pipeline"
- "Ramp new CSMs in ~2 months instead of six with centralized context" (Vaishali Reed)
- "Turn CS into revenue success — CRO visibility into renewal and expansion"
