# Use Case: Predictable Forecast and Pipeline Visibility

## Overview
Revenue leaders and RevOps need one place to see the number, pipeline, and execution — with data grounded in real buyer and customer activity, not just CRM input. This use case addresses forecast surprises, multiple "versions of the truth," and the need to act on real-time signals across deals and renewals.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Technology, financial services, healthcare, or other B2B with material revenue teams
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; dozens to hundreds of reps; complex GTM
- **Characteristics**: Already use CRM and often multiple point tools; forecast and pipeline are critical to board and exec reviews

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Leader (CRO), VP Sales; often co-owned by RevOps
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: RevOps (data, systems), Sales leaders (field adoption), Finance (number commitment)

### Trigger Event
Missed quarter or forecast miss; new CRO or board mandate for "better visibility"; consolidation from multiple tools to one source of truth; need to reduce forecast gaming and bias

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Forecast and pipeline live in CRM, spreadsheets, and gut feel; reconciliation is manual and lagging
- No single place for real-time, unbiased view of the number; risk and upside surface late
- Reps and leaders may not trust or use the same data RevOps maintains
- Renewal and churn risk appear late in the cycle

### Desired State (After)
- One place for forecast, pipeline, and execution; data backed by every customer interaction
- Real-time signals across deals and renewals; act before surprises
- Org aligned on the same number; ownership and accountability (e.g. Crayon)
- Predictable revenue and confidence in the number

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Gong Forecast, Gong Revenue Graph
- **Supporting**: Gong Engage (signals, pipeline motion), Gong Collective (CRM and tool sync)

### Solution Overview
Revenue Graph captures every interaction and maps it to deals and accounts; Forecast surfaces pipeline and forecast analytics, deal alerts (pricing, competition, buyer activity), and paths to target. Leaders and RevOps get one view; data is objective and tied to actual buyer/customer activity.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Gong and connect revenue-critical sources (calls, meetings, email, CRM) via Revenue Graph and Collective
2. Configure forecast views, deal alerts, and pipeline change tracking for leadership and RevOps
3. Align sales and CS on using the same pipeline and forecast data in Gong
4. Run regular forecast and pipeline reviews from Gong; tie back to board and exec updates

## Value Delivered
