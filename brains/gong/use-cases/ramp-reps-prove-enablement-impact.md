# Use Case: Ramp Reps Faster and Prove Enablement Impact

## Overview
Enablement and sales leaders need to shorten ramp time and tie training to real outcomes — win rates, deal velocity, pipeline — instead of completion rates alone. This use case addresses the gap between "we trained on it" and "reps actually do it in deals," and the need to prove enablement ROI to leadership.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B with dedicated enablement; technology, financial services, healthcare, or other
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; enablement team and sales/CS managers as stakeholders
- **Characteristics**: Already run onboarding and training; may use LMS or content tools; under pressure to show impact

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Enablement Leader (VP Enablement, Head of Sales Enablement); Sales and CS leaders as champions
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales managers (coaching), RevOps (data, adoption), CRO (sponsor for impact)

### Trigger Event
Ramp time or win rate under pressure; new enablement or sales leader; "we need to prove impact"; budget review ("what's the ROI of enablement?"); new segment or product requiring consistent execution

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Enablement measured by completion rates and attendance; hard to tie to win rate or deal velocity
- Gap between learning and landing: unclear if reps actually use methodology or best practices in customer conversations
- New reps take months to ramp; coaching is 1:1 and doesn't scale; hard to replicate top performers
- Managers don't have objective view of where each rep needs coaching (messaging, next steps, stalled deals)

### Desired State (After)
- Enablement tied to win rates, deal velocity, and pipeline; prove impact, not just effort
- Visibility into execution: are reps applying what they learned? What's sticking, what's slipping?
- Faster ramp with onboarding built from real customer conversations; skill gaps and methodology adherence visible
- Managers get coaching moments and execution data so they can reinforce what works and intervene where it matters

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Gong platform (execution, adoption, methodology tracking), Revenue Graph (conversation and behavior data)
- **Supporting**: Gong Engage (context for reps), Agents (reduce admin so reps and managers focus on execution); integrations (Highspot, Seismic, etc.) for content

### Solution Overview
Revenue Graph and platform visibility show how rep behavior and coaching actually impact the bottom line. Track methodology adherence (e.g. "next steps," talk tracks) and tie to deal velocity and win rates. Onboarding and skill gaps are informed by real conversation data so ramp is faster. Managers get coaching moments (messaging misses, stalled deals) so they can "turn managers into enablement multipliers." Result: prove impact, shorten ramp, and scale coaching.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Gong and connect revenue-critical sources; ensure conversation and activity data feed the platform
2. Define key behaviors and methodology (e.g. next steps, discovery, closing) and track adoption and execution in Gong
3. Use Gong for onboarding: new reps learn from real customer conversations and see where they need to improve
4. Equip managers with Gong visibility (coaching moments, execution data) so 1:1s and deal reviews are data-driven

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Ramp time | e.g. Iron Mountain: onboarding times cut in half |
| Win rate (methodology / execution) | e.g. Highspot: +7% win rates with methodology; SpotOn: +16% win rate (productivity/execution) |
| Deal velocity (behavior tracking) | e.g. Culture Amp: improvement in deal velocity with next-steps tracking |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Prove enablement impact with data (win rate, deal velocity, pipeline) — not just completion
- "Go from support function to strategic driver"; become a strategic growth partner
- Scale coaching; managers know where to intervene and what to reinforce
- Replicate winning behaviors with visibility into what actually closes deals

## Proof Points

### Customer Example
- **Company**: Iron Mountain
- **Challenge**: Long onboarding; need new hires to reach productivity faster
- **Solution**: Gong for onboarding and ramp; measure time to "learn products, get in touch with customers, and start hitting your number"
- **Results**: Onboarding times cut in half
- **Quote**: "We're cutting onboarding times in half. And we measure that based on how long it takes you to come in, learn the products, get in touch with your customers and start hitting your number." — Christine Canfield, VP SMB Inside Sales, Iron Mountain

### Data Points
- Highspot: +7% win rates when utilizing methodology (Alicia Heagle, Manager Revenue Enablement)
- Culture Amp: deal velocity improvement with next-steps tracking (Simon Kirk, VP Revenue Enablement)
- Gong positioning: "Turn enablement programs into revenue"; "Bridge the gap between learning and landing the deal"

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How do you measure enablement today — and how do you tie it to win rates, deal velocity, or pipeline?
2. When you roll out a new methodology or program, how do you know if reps are actually using it in customer conversations?
3. How long does it take a new rep to ramp to full productivity — and what would need to change to cut that in half?
4. Do managers have a clear view of where each rep needs coaching (e.g. messaging, next steps, stalled deals) without chasing context?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Execution and adoption: are reps using methodology and best practices in deals?
- Methodology tracking: e.g. next steps, discovery, talk tracks; tie to deal velocity and win rate
- Onboarding: how new reps use real conversation data to ramp
- Manager view: coaching moments, messaging gaps, stalled behaviors — "turn managers into enablement multipliers"

### Key Talking Points
- "Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth — connect enablement to win rates and deal velocity"
- "Bridge the gap between learning and landing — see what's sticking and what to do next"
- "Cut onboarding in half" (Iron Mountain); "+7% win rates with methodology" (Highspot)
- "Turn managers into enablement multipliers — surface coaching moments so everyone can reinforce what works"
