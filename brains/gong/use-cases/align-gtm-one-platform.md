# Use Case: Align GTM on One Platform

## Overview
CROs and RevOps need sales, customer success, enablement, and RevOps on the same data and the same platform — instead of siloed tools and multiple "versions of the truth." This use case addresses misalignment, duplicate effort, and the inability to scale winning behaviors or fix what's broken quickly.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B with a multi-function GTM org (sales, CS, enablement, RevOps)
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; often post-scale-up or post-acquisition
- **Characteristics**: Multiple point tools (call intelligence, engagement, forecast, CS, enablement); desire to consolidate and align

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Leader (CRO); often driven with RevOps as implementer
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: RevOps, Sales leaders, CS leaders, Enablement

### Trigger Event
New CRO or "one source of truth" mandate; reorg that combines sales and CS; tool consolidation or cost initiative; missed quarter attributed to misalignment; M&A or new product line requiring unified GTM

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps use different tools and data; no shared view of pipeline, execution, or what's working
- Handoffs (e.g. sales to CS) are incomplete; duplicate or conflicting touchpoints
- Initiatives (enablement, new plays) don't land in the field because visibility and data are siloed
- Multiple forecasts and pipeline views; "who owns the number?" debates

### Desired State (After)
- One platform for pipeline, forecast, engagement, and customer context; one source of truth
- Every GTM function works from the same data; alignment and accountability
- Winning behaviors and strategy can be scaled and measured across the org
- "It takes every team to hit the number" — and every team has the same view

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Gong Revenue AI OS (Revenue Graph + Engage + Forecast + Agents + Collective)
- **Supporting**: Gong Collective (integrations so CRM and existing tools feed one platform)

### Solution Overview
Revenue Graph is the single data layer: every interaction captured and connected to deals and accounts. Engage, Forecast, and Agents are purpose-built apps on top; Collective keeps CRM and 250+ tools in sync. Sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps all use Gong for pipeline, context, forecasting, and workflows — so strategy and execution align.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Gong and Revenue Graph; connect all revenue-critical sources (calls, meetings, email, CRM) via Collective
2. Roll out Forecast and Engage to sales and CS; align on one pipeline and forecast process
3. Enable enablement and RevOps to use Gong for execution, adoption, and initiative impact
4. Run cross-functional reviews (revenue, pipeline, renewal, enablement) from one platform

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Lead conversion / alignment | e.g. Frontify: 30% increase in lead conversion when RevOps and reps aligned |
| Consistency and 1:1 impact | DemandScience: "level of consistency we haven't had"; "much more impactful 1:1s" |
| Consolidation and efficiency | Frontify: "one platform where you can do everything — pipeline management to forecasting" |

### Qualitative Benefits
- One source of truth; no more reconciling silos
- Sales, CS, enablement, RevOps aligned on the same number and priorities
- Scale what works; course-correct faster with shared visibility
- CRO and board get one narrative: productivity, predictability, growth

## Proof Points

### Customer Example
- **Company**: Frontify
- **Challenge**: Need for consolidation and alignment across RevOps and reps; productivity and sophisticated insights
- **Solution**: Gong as single platform for pipeline management, forecasting, and insights; alignment across RevOps and reps
- **Results**: 30% increase in lead conversion; "consolidation has been the main driver"
- **Quote**: "Consolidation has been the main driver — one platform where you can do everything, from pipeline management to forecasting, with productivity and sophisticated insights." — Naya Tsoukala, Head of Revenue Operations, Frontify

### Data Points
- DemandScience: "Consistency we haven't had"; "much more impactful 1:1s for our leaders/reps" (Eric Choronzy, VP North America Sales)
- Gong positioning: "It takes every team to hit the number"; unified GTM org

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How many places do sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps go today to get pipeline, forecast, and activity — and do they match?
2. When you roll out a new play or enablement program, how do you know if it's actually being used and driving results?
3. What would change if every GTM team had the same view of the number and the same context on every account?
4. How smooth are handoffs (e.g. sales to CS) today — and where does context get lost?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Revenue Graph: one data layer for every interaction and every team
- Forecast and pipeline: same view for sales, CS, RevOps
- Engage and context: full account story for sales and CS; handoffs and collaboration
- Collective: how CRM and tools feed one platform so there’s one source of truth

### Key Talking Points
- "It takes every team to hit the number — align sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps on one platform"
- "One source of truth; no more silos or multiple versions of the forecast"
- "30% lead conversion increase when RevOps and reps aligned on the same platform" (Frontify)
