# Use Case: Scale Rep Productivity Without Proportional Headcount

## Overview
Sales and CS leaders need more pipeline and outcomes from the same team — without adding headcount. This use case addresses admin overload (notes, emails, CRM updates), lack of buyer context, and the need to automate follow-ups and next steps so reps spend time selling and coaching, not documenting.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; technology, financial services, healthcare, or other verticals with inside or field sales
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; team size from ~20 to hundreds of reps
- **Characteristics**: Already use CRM and often call/meeting tools; rep productivity and ramp are key metrics

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader (VP Sales, Director), CS Leader; often championed with RevOps
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Reps (AEs, SDRs/BDRs, CSMs), Enablement (ramp, methodology)

### Trigger Event
Need to grow pipeline without proportional hire; rep turnover or ramp pressure; "reps are buried in admin"; board or CRO ask for productivity gains; post-COVID/hybrid selling efficiency focus

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Reps spend significant time on call notes, meeting summaries, follow-up emails, and CRM updates
- Context is scattered; reps and managers chase "what happened" across tools
- Follow-ups are manual and slow; next steps get dropped or delayed
- Managers spend 1:1 time gathering context instead of coaching

### Desired State (After)
- AI captures every interaction and generates summaries, follow-ups, and suggested next steps
- Reps have full account context in the flow of work; less time on admin, more on selling
- Pipeline and CRM stay current with less manual entry; deal and renewal signals surface automatically
- Managers coach on substance, not data gathering

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Gong Revenue Graph (auto-capture), Gong Agents (follow-ups, pipeline edits, summaries)
- **Supporting**: Gong Engage (context, workflows), Gong Forecast (visibility so managers don’t chase)

### Solution Overview
Revenue Graph automatically captures every customer interaction and maps it to deals and accounts. Agents automate follow-ups, pipeline updates, and enablement triggers; AI generates summaries and draft emails. Engage delivers full account context and targeted actions so reps prioritize and personalize at scale. Result: more selling time, faster follow-up, and managers with visibility for coaching.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Gong and connect calls, meetings, email, and CRM; ensure Revenue Graph is capturing and mapping interactions
2. Enable Gong Agents for follow-ups, pipeline edits, and summaries per your workflow
3. Roll out Engage and context surfaces so reps see full account story and next best actions
4. Train managers on using Gong for pipeline and deal reviews instead of asking reps to re-report

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |

| Pipeline feed / productivity | e.g. EdgePetrol: 300% increase in pipeline feed with time reallocated |
| Buyer response / engagement | e.g. Uber for Business: 32% lift in buyer response with AI Tracker |

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How much time do reps spend on call notes, follow-ups, and CRM updates vs. actual selling or customer conversations?
2. When managers do pipeline or deal reviews, where does the "real" context come from?
3. What would it mean for the business if every rep had 5–10 more hours per week for selling?
4. How do you follow up after calls or meetings — and how often do next steps slip?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Auto-capture and Revenue Graph: every interaction connected to deals and accounts
- Agents: follow-up suggestions, pipeline updates, summary generation
- Engage: full account context, next best actions, personalized outreach
- Manager view: pipeline and deal visibility without asking reps to re-report

### Key Talking Points
- "Replace admin work with high-impact activities — AI that generates summaries, suggests follow-ups, and drafts emails"
- "Give reps more time to close; give managers visibility without the status meeting"
- "6,700 hours saved; 32% lift in buyer response — productivity and outcomes at scale"
