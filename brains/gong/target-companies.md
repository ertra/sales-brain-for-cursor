# Target Companies

## Overview
Gong sells to enterprise revenue organizations that want productivity, predictability, and growth. Target companies run GTM at scale and need a single source of truth for pipeline, forecasting, engagement, and customer insights. Primary segments are by **industry** (Technology, Financial Services, Healthcare) and by **buying role** (Revenue leaders, RevOps, Enablement, Sales, Customer Success). Trusted by 5,000+ customers including a significant share of the FORTUNE 10; positioning is enterprise-ready with strong security and compliance.
