# Sales - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales teams are buried in admin work and lack clarity on what actually drives wins. They discover forecast and deal risk too late, and enablement often doesn’t translate into measurable outcomes. Reps and managers need better data and less manual work to hit targets.

## Pain Points

### 1. Buried in admin work (summaries, emails, CRM updates)
- **Description**: Reps spend significant time on call notes, meeting summaries, follow-up emails, and CRM updates instead of selling. Managers chase updates and context.
- **Impact**: Less time in front of buyers; slower follow-up; reps feel like “data entry clerks”; productivity and pipeline suffer.
- **Current Solutions**: Templates, assistants, or acceptance of low CRM quality and manual work.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Agents, Engage, Revenue Graph (auto-capture)
- **Key Message**: “Replace admin work with high-impact activities — AI that generates summaries, suggests follow-ups, and drafts emails.”

### 2. Blind to the right buying signals
- **Description**: Hard to know which deals are advancing, which are at risk, and what buyers actually care about; context lives in calls and emails, not in one place.
- **Impact**: Missed next steps; deals slip; coaching and pipeline reviews lack substance; wrong deals prioritized.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual listening, spot checks, CRM fields that reps don’t keep current.
- **Frequency**: Daily / per deal
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, Engage (full account context), Forecast (deal alerts)
- **Key Message**: “Drive performance with contextual data — see how reps engage buyers and keep your forecast grounded in reality.”

### 3. Unclear what drives wins; guesswork in coaching
- **Description**: Managers don’t have objective view of what top performers do differently; coaching is based on anecdotes and incomplete data.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent execution; long ramp; enablement and coaching not tied to what actually closes deals.
- **Frequency**: Weekly (1:1s, pipeline reviews)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, platform (execution and adoption), Engage
- **Key Message**: “Take the guesswork out of coaching — understand what’s moving the needle and turn every rep into a high performer.”

### 4. Forecast surprises and deal risk too late
- **Description**: Deal risk (pricing, competition, stalled activity) surfaces at the end of the quarter or in the CRM only after the fact.
- **Impact**: Forecast misses; last-minute scrambles; reps and managers surprised by lost deals.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly (forecast cycles)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Forecast (deal alerts, pipeline change tracking, buyer activity)
- **Key Message**: “Forecast your number with confidence — spot forecast risks sooner with pipeline change tracking and deal alerts.”

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time do reps spend on call notes, follow-up emails, and CRM updates vs. actual selling?
2. When you do pipeline or deal reviews, where does the “real” context come from — CRM or somewhere else?
3. How do you know what top performers do differently, and how do you coach the rest of the team to replicate it?
4. When do you usually find out a deal is at risk — and what would you need to see it earlier?

## Trigger Events
- Missed quarter or forecast miss
- New sales leader; “we need better visibility and coaching”
- Ramp time or win rate under pressure
- New product or segment requiring consistent execution
