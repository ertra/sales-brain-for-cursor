# Customer Success - Pain Points

## Overview
CS teams chase context across systems and often see churn and renewal risk too late. New CSMs take too long to ramp, and collaboration with sales and other teams is hampered by fragmented account visibility. They need one place to see what’s really happening post-sale and act before it’s too late.

## Pain Points

### 1. Chasing context; no single view of customer interactions
- **Description**: Account and interaction context is scattered across CRM, calls, emails, and other tools; CSMs spend time digging instead of engaging customers.
- **Impact**: Slower response; missed signals; new CSMs ramp slowly (e.g. six months down to two with Gong — Vaishali Reed).
- **Current Solutions**: Manual handoffs, shared drives, asking sales or support for “what happened.”
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Revenue Graph, platform (full account visibility)
- **Key Message**: “Stop chasing context — give your entire team full visibility into customer interactions and pipeline.”

### 2. Renewal and churn risk discovered too late
- **Description**: Signs of risk (engagement drop, feedback, pricing concerns) aren’t visible until late in the renewal cycle or after escalation.
- **Impact**: Surprise churn; last-minute saves; missed expansion; inaccurate renewal forecast.
- **Current Solutions**: Health scores based on limited data; reactive check-ins; post-mortems after churn.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / renewal cycles
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Forecast, Revenue Graph (signals), Engage
- **Key Message**: “Turn customer signals into forecast certainty — track renewal likelihood and churn risk early so teams can act before it’s too late.”

### 3. Long ramp for new CSMs
- **Description**: New CSMs take months to get full picture of accounts, history, and how to prioritize; knowledge lives in people’s heads or scattered systems.
- **Impact**: Slower time-to-value for customers; burnout; inconsistent coverage during turnover.
- **Current Solutions**: Shadowing, wikis, hope that tenure builds context.
- **Frequency**: Per hire / ongoing
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph (centralized context), Agents (reduce admin), platform visibility
- **Key Message**: “Ramp and align customer-facing teams faster — cut ramp time with centralized account context and less admin work.”

### 4. Disconnect between sales and CS; no shared account story
- **Description**: Handoffs from sales to CS are incomplete; sales and CS don’t share the same view of the account (past convos, commitments, next steps).
- **Impact**: Duplicate or conflicting touchpoints; missed expansion signals; customer frustration.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / per account
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, Engage (full account story across teams)
- **Key Message**: “Strengthen collaboration — from sales to proserv to product, give everyone the full account story so you can align and act fast.”

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Chasing context / no single view | High | Daily | Revenue Graph, platform | Every interaction captured and connected for post-sale |
| Renewal/churn risk late | High | Monthly–Renewal | Forecast, signals | Real-time signals from customer interactions |
| Long CSM ramp | Medium–High | Per hire | Revenue Graph, Agents | Centralized context + less admin |
| Sales–CS disconnect | High | Ongoing | Revenue Graph, Engage | One account story across GTM |

## Discovery Questions
1. Where do CSMs get the full picture of an account today — and how long does it take a new CSM to feel fully up to speed?
2. When do you typically know a renewal is at risk — and what signals do you wish you had earlier?
3. How smooth is the handoff from sales to CS, and do both teams use the same view of the account?
4. How much time do CSMs spend finding context vs. actually engaging customers?

## Trigger Events
- Churn spike or key logo at risk
- New CS leadership; “we need better visibility and predictability”
- Scaling CS team; ramp and consistency become critical
- Reorg that puts CS and sales under one leader (alignment mandate)
