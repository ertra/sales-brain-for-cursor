# Revenue Leader (CRO) - Pain Points

## Overview
Revenue leaders struggle with forecast surprises, siloed GTM teams, and lack of unbiased visibility into pipeline and execution. They spend time on manual reporting and firefighting instead of coaching and strategy, and often see churn or renewal risk too late.

## Pain Points

### 1. Forecast surprises and lack of unbiased visibility
- **Description**: Pipeline and forecast are scattered across CRM, spreadsheets, and gut feel; no single place for real-time, objective view of the number and execution. Risk and upside surface too late.
- **Impact**: Missed quarters; board and investor tension; reactive decisions instead of strategic course-correction.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual rollups, spreadsheets, CRM dashboards that don’t reflect actual buyer activity; repeated “inspect what you expect” meetings.
- **Frequency**: Weekly to quarterly (acute at quarter-end and board cycles).
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Forecast, Revenue Graph
- **Key Message**: “Get a clear line of sight into your forecast, pipeline, and strategy execution — all in one place.”

### 2. GTM teams working in silos
- **Description**: Sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps use different data and tools; no shared view of what’s working in the field or how strategy is landing.
- **Impact**: Misalignment; duplicate effort; inability to scale winning behaviors or fix what’s broken quickly.
- **Current Solutions**: Cross-functional meetings, manual handoffs, multiple tools that don’t connect.
- **Frequency**: Daily / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue AI OS (Revenue Graph, Engage, Forecast, Agents, Collective)
- **Key Message**: “It takes every team to hit the number. Align sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps on one platform.”

### 3. Time on non-selling work and manual reporting
- **Description**: Reps and managers spend hours on admin, call notes, CRM updates, and reporting instead of selling and coaching.
- **Impact**: Lower productivity; leaders can’t focus on strategy and coaching; pipeline feed and rep capacity suffer.
- **Current Solutions**: More headcount, overtime, or acceptance of “that’s just how it is.”
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Agents, Engage, Revenue Graph (auto-capture)
- **Key Message**: “Unlock more revenue per rep — align GTM teams faster and reduce time spent on non-selling work.”

### 4. Churn and renewal risk visible too late
- **Description**: Renewal and expansion risk isn’t clear until late in the cycle; missing early signals from customer interactions and engagement.
- **Impact**: Surprise churn; last-minute saves; missed expansion; inaccurate renewal forecast.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / quarterly (renewal cycles)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Forecast, Revenue Graph, Engage (signals across deals and renewals)
- **Key Message**: “See what’s coming — improve forecasts and reduce churn by acting on real-time signals across deals and renewals.”

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you get to your number today — and how often does the actual result match the forecast?
2. Where does your forecast live, and how much of it is based on real buyer/customer activity vs. rep input?
3. How aligned are sales, CS, enablement, and RevOps on the same data and priorities?
4. What percentage of rep and manager time goes to admin, notes, and reporting vs. selling and coaching?
5. When do you typically find out a renewal is at risk — and what would you need to see it earlier?

## Trigger Events
- Missed quarterly forecast or board scrutiny
- Reorg or new CRO/VP Sales; “we need one source of truth”
- Churn spike or surprise logo loss
- Scaling headcount without proportional pipeline growth
- M&A or new product line requiring GTM alignment
