# Enablement - Pain Points

## Overview
Enablement leaders struggle to prove impact beyond completion rates and are often seen as a support function. They can’t easily connect training to win rates or deal velocity, and ramp times stay long. They need to bridge the gap between learning and landing the deal and turn managers into force multipliers.

## Pain Points

### 1. Enablement seen as support, not strategic; impact hard to prove
- **Description**: Programs are measured by LMS completion and attendance, not by behavior change or revenue impact; hard to show ROI to leadership.
- **Impact**: Budget and headcount at risk; enablement not invited to strategic conversations; “training for training’s sake” perception.
- **Current Solutions**: Surveys, anecdotes, hope that “more training” helps; some try to tie to CRM activity (incomplete picture).
- **Frequency**: Quarterly / budget cycles
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, platform (execution and adoption), tie to win rates and deal velocity
- **Key Message**: “Prove how initiatives impact revenue growth — connect enablement to win rates, deal size, and pipeline coverage.”

### 2. Gap between learning and landing the deal
- **Description**: Reps complete training but execution in the field is unclear; no objective view of whether methodology, talk tracks, or behaviors are actually used in deals.
- **Impact**: Can’t iterate on what works; coaching and training not grounded in reality; “we trained on it” doesn’t mean it landed.
- **Current Solutions**: Manager feedback, spot checks; often no systematic visibility.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, platform (execution and adoption), methodology tracking
- **Key Message**: “Bridge the gap between learning and landing — ditch surface-level metrics for AI-driven visibility into how rep behavior impacts the bottom line.”

### 3. Long ramp times; difficulty scaling coaching
- **Description**: New reps take too long to reach productivity; coaching is 1:1 and doesn’t scale; hard to replicate top performers.
- **Impact**: Slower revenue growth; cost of turnover; managers overwhelmed with coaching load.
- **Current Solutions**: More onboarding sessions, playbooks, hope that tenure fixes it (e.g. Iron Mountain cut onboarding in half with Gong).
- **Frequency**: Per hire / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Platform (onboarding from real conversations, skill gaps, methodology adherence), Agents
- **Key Message**: “Accelerate onboarding, coaching, and skills development — ramp reps faster with onboarding built from real customer conversations.”

### 4. Managers not equipped to coach where it counts
- **Description**: Managers don’t have timely, objective view of rep performance (messaging misses, stalled deals, key moments); coaching is reactive or generic.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent execution; managers spend time gathering context instead of coaching; enablement doesn’t “stick” in the field.
- **Frequency**: Weekly (1:1s, deal reviews)
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Platform (manager visibility), “Turn managers into enablement multipliers”
- **Key Message**: “Surface messaging misses, stalled deal behaviors, and key coaching moments — so everyone can align on how to intervene and what to reinforce.”

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Impact hard to prove | High | Quarterly | Platform, Revenue Graph | Tie enablement to win rates and deal velocity |
| Learning vs. landing gap | High | Ongoing | Revenue Graph, execution data | Objective view of rep behavior in deals |
| Long ramp / scaling coaching | High | Per hire | Platform, onboarding, Agents | Built from real conversations; skill gaps and methodology |
| Managers not equipped to coach | Medium–High | Weekly | Platform visibility | Coaching moments and execution data in one place |

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you measure enablement today — and how do you tie it to win rates, deal velocity, or pipeline?
2. When you roll out a new methodology or program, how do you know if reps are actually using it in customer conversations?
3. How long does it take a new rep to ramp to full productivity — and what would need to change to cut that in half?
4. Do managers have a clear view of where each rep needs coaching (e.g. messaging, next steps, stalled deals) without chasing context?

## Trigger Events
- New enablement or sales leader; “we need to prove impact”
- Ramp time or win rate under pressure
- Reorg or new segment requiring consistent execution
- Budget review; “what’s the ROI of enablement?”
