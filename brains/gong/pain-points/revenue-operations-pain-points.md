# Revenue Operations - Pain Points

## Overview
RevOps teams are stuck with fragmented data across CRM, calls, and other tools, and spend time on reactive reporting instead of strategic initiatives. They struggle to align the field on one source of truth and to prove the impact of GTM programs.

## Pain Points

### 1. Fragmented data and no single source of truth
- **Description**: Revenue data lives in CRM, call/meeting tools, email, and spreadsheets; manual reconciliation and no unified view of pipeline, activity, and outcomes.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent numbers; duplicate work; inability to trust one forecast or pipeline view; slow, reactive reporting.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual exports, spreadsheets, multiple dashboards; point-to-point integrations that break or lag.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Gong Revenue Graph, Gong Collective (integrations)
- **Key Message**: “Automate workflows, enhance your data engine, and align teams with a single source of truth.”

### 2. Reactive instead of strategic
- **Description**: Most time goes to pulling numbers, fixing data, and answering one-off questions instead of driving strategic initiatives and leading indicators.
- **Impact**: RevOps perceived as reporting function; missed opportunities to improve conversion, forecast accuracy, and rep productivity.
- **Current Solutions**: More headcount or tools that add complexity without unifying data.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, Forecast, Intelligence (AI-driven insights)
- **Key Message**: “Shift from reactive to strategic — power strategic initiatives with AI-driven insights.”

### 3. Can’t prove impact of initiatives
- **Description**: Hard to tie programs (enablement, new plays, tooling) to win rates, deal velocity, or pipeline conversion; “we did training” isn’t enough.
- **Impact**: Budget and credibility at risk; difficulty scaling what works and killing what doesn’t.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / quarterly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Graph, Forecast, platform visibility (execution and adoption)
- **Key Message**: “Turn winning behaviors into scalable workflows — with clear data on what’s working.”

### 4. Field and RevOps not aligned on the same numbers
- **Description**: Reps and leaders don’t trust or use the same pipeline/forecast data RevOps maintains; multiple versions of “the truth.”
- **Impact**: Misalignment; forecast gaming; initiatives that don’t land in the field (e.g. methodology, process).
- **Current Solutions**: More process, more meetings; often still inconsistent.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue AI OS (unified platform), Collective (CRM and tool sync)
- **Key Message**: “Align RevOps and reps — e.g. 30% increase in lead conversion when teams are on the same page.” (Frontify)

## Discovery Questions
1. How many places do you go today to get pipeline, activity, and forecast — and how do you reconcile them?
2. What share of RevOps time is reactive (reporting, data fixes) vs. strategic (initiatives, modeling, improvement)?
3. When you roll out a new play or enablement program, how do you know if it’s actually being used and driving results?
4. Do reps and leaders use the same pipeline and forecast data you maintain, or do they have their own spreadsheets and views?

## Trigger Events
- New RevOps lead or “we need one source of truth” mandate
- CRM or tool consolidation project
- Missed forecast or board ask for “better visibility”
- New CRO or sales leader demanding alignment and accountability
