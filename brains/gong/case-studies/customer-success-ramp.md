| **Industry** | [To be confirmed] |
| **Company Size** | [To be confirmed] |

## Executive Summary
With Gong, CSM onboarding time was reduced from six months to just over two months. New CSMs get full account and customer context in one place, so they ramp faster and managers can coach from reality. Director of Global Customer Success & Programs Operations cited Gong as the key enabler for shrinking onboarding from six months to ~2 months.

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- New CSMs took ~6 months to onboard and feel fully productive
- Context was scattered; knowledge in people's heads or across tools
- Ramp was a bottleneck for scaling CS

### Key Pain Points

- Chasing context across systems
- Inconsistent coverage during turnover or growth

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Gong
- Centralized account and customer context in one platform
- New CSMs use Gong for full visibility without digging
- Managers coach from real data; less admin for CSMs

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Gong Revenue Graph, platform | Full account context; post-sale visibility |
