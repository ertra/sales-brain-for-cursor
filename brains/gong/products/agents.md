# Gong Agents

## Company
Gong

## Overview
Specialized AI agents for revenue teams that automate follow-ups, pipeline edits, enablement triggers, and forecast corrections. Built to handle the grunt work so reps and managers can focus on selling and coaching.

## Main Features
- Automated follow-ups (e.g. post-call, post-meeting)
- Pipeline and CRM updates driven by AI (e.g. deal stage, next steps)
- Enablement triggers (e.g. suggest content, plays based on conversation)
- Forecast corrections and risk/opportunity surfacing
- Purpose-built for revenue workflows (not generic chatbots)
- Tuned on revenue data from the Gong Revenue Graph

## Problem Solved
Reps and managers spend hours on admin, data entry, and repetitive follow-up. Gong Agents reduce that burden and keep CRM and forecast aligned with what actually happened in customer interactions.

## Value Proposition
Get help with the grunt work so the team can focus on winning. Example: Uber for Business saved 6,700 hours across call prep, follow-up, and CRM updates; AI Tracker agent helped lift buyer response rates by 32%.

## Target Customers
Revenue ops, sales managers, and frontline reps who want less manual admin and more time selling; organizations already using Gong for capture and insights who want automation and orchestration.

## Competition
