## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Classter (Vertitech SA) |
| **Industry** | Education Technology (EdTech) |
| **Products Used** | AiSDR Platform (AI Strategist, HubSpot integration, Live AI signals, website visitor, enrichment) |
| **Primary Persona** | Sales / Marketing (Teo Dimitrakoudis, Director of Sales; Thivanka Balasooriya, Marketing & Growth Strategist) |
| **Use Case** | Outbound + inbound nurturing + website visitor / intent-based outreach; pipeline and meeting volume |

## Executive Summary

Classter’s growth team was managing outbound, inbound nurturing, and website visitor follow-up manually while trying to keep HubSpot as single source of truth. They needed to scale personalized email and LinkedIn outreach without sacrificing quality or CRM data. Using AiSDR’s full stack—AI Strategist, deep HubSpot sync, automated enrichment, Live AI signals, and website visitor campaigns—they achieved **21.43% positive response rate** (HubSpot nurturing), **16.95%** from website ID campaigns, **4.6%** from outbound signal-based campaigns, **81 meetings booked**, and **$750,920 pipeline** in HubSpot, with a clean CRM and team focused on high-value conversations.

## The Customer

- **Company**: Classter — cloud-based education management system; helps educational organizations streamline administration and digitalize academic processes.
- **Adoption**: 500+ educational organizations; 300,000+ active users across multiple regions.
- **Team**: Marketing & Growth (Thivanka Balasooriya); Director of Sales (Teo Dimitrakoudis).
- **Location**: Greece.

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- Multiple outreach initiatives (outbound, inbound nurture, website visitor follow-up) managed manually.
- HubSpot as single source of truth but contact data accuracy and freshness at risk as volume grew.
- Needed to ramp personalized email and LinkedIn outreach while keeping quality high and CRM clean.

### Key Pain Points
- Manual outbound couldn’t scale.
- Website visitors went unengaged.
- CRM data quality at risk with higher volume.

## The Solution

### Why They Chose AiSDR
- “What stood out about AiSDR is that it’s not just about scraping information, building lists, and sending emails. All the technical infrastructure: warming up domains, managing inboxes, even purchasing new domains is handled for us. Most platforms make you piece together multiple vendors. AiSDR gives you the complete package.” — Thivanka Balasooriya.
- AI Strategist for campaign creation; deep HubSpot integration; automated enrichment; Live AI signals; website visitor campaigns.

### Capabilities Used

| Website visitor / de-anonymization | Engage visitors at the right moment (16.95% RR) |
| Live AI signals | Outbound signal-based campaigns (4.6% RR) |
| Enrichment | Keep contact data accurate and up-to-date |

## The Results

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Positive response rate (HubSpot nurturing) | 21.43% |
| Response rate (website ID campaign) | 16.95% |
| Response rate (HubSpot nurturing campaigns) | 21.83% |
| Response rate (outbound signal-based) | 4.5–4.6% |

| Pipeline generated | $750,920 |

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Clean CRM; growth team freed to focus on high-value conversations instead of manual outreach.
- “I like very much the UI. It is very simple. You should use it fully.” — Teo Dimitrakoudis, Director of Sales.

## Sales Use

### Best For
- EdTech and education; growth teams running outbound + inbound + website visitor.
- Teams that want one platform for list, nurture, and intent-based outreach with HubSpot as source of truth.
- Proof for “complete package” (infrastructure + domains + inboxes + campaigns) vs. piecing vendors together.

### Key Talking Points
1. “$750K pipeline and 81 meetings — outbound, inbound nurture, and website visitor in one platform.”
2. “21.43% positive response rate on HubSpot nurturing; 16.95% on website visitor campaigns.”
3. “All infrastructure handled — domains, warmup, inboxes — so you’re not piecing vendors together.”

### Objections This Addresses
- “We need to keep HubSpot clean.” → Enrichment and sync; single source of truth.
- “Multiple tools are a mess.” → Complete package; one platform.
- “Can AI do our niche?” → EdTech proof; 500+ orgs, 300K+ users.
