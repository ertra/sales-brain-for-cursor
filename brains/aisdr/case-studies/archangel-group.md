# Case Study: The Archangel Group

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | The Archangel Group |
| **Industry** | Business consulting (veteran-owned); government and commercial contracts |
| **Products Used** | AiSDR Platform (email infrastructure, inbox management, campaigns; GTM engineer, Customer Success) |
| **Primary Persona** | RevOps / Agency Lead (Ricardo Mong, CEO & Founder) |
| **Use Case** | Scale cold outreach for 7 clients without adding headcount; omnichannel (email + LinkedIn) |

## Executive Summary

The Archangel Group had strong results in securing contracts but demand outgrew manual outreach. They needed to scale personalized outreach for multiple clients without losing quality or adding headcount. AiSDR took over email infrastructure, inbox management, and campaign execution; the agency onboarded **7 clients** (legal tech, construction, healthcare, B2B services) and sent **25,000+ personalized emails**. Cold outreach reply rates up to **7.12%**; LinkedIn positive response **4.17%**; email positive response **4.29%**. Quote: “The biggest advantage for us is the consistency AiSDR brings to our outreach. The flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI.” — Ricardo Mong.

## The Customer

- **Company**: The Archangel Group — veteran-owned consulting agency; sales outreach, proposal development, market entry strategies; government and commercial contracts.
- **Team**: Founding team (Ricardo Mong, CEO & Founder).
- **Location**: United States.

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- Proven track record, but growing demand put pressure on outreach.
- Clients expected more opportunities; manual scaling wasn’t sustainable.
- Relying on networking, inbound, and traditional cold outreach had limits; personalization at scale was hard.
- Lost leads from inconsistent follow-ups and generic outreach; scaling without automation meant less personalization or higher cost.

### Key Pain Points
- Demand outgrew manual outreach.
- Lost leads from poor engagement.
- Personalization was hard to scale.

## The Solution

### Why They Chose AiSDR
- AiSDR handled email infrastructure (domain procurement, DNS, inbox setup); “They handle all the email infrastructure setup for you. Domain procurement, DNS records, and even adding pictures to the inboxes to improve open rates.” — Ricardo Mong.
- Dedicated GTM engineer and Customer Success Manager; later expanded to a team of managers as campaigns grew.
- One platform for 7 clients; email-only and omnichannel (email + LinkedIn) campaigns.

### Capabilities Used
| Capability | Role |
|------------|------|
| Email infrastructure | Domain procurement, DNS, inbox setup, warmup |
| Campaign execution | 25,000+ personalized emails; multi-client |
| Omnichannel | Email + LinkedIn follow-ups |
| GTM engineer + CSM | Onboarding and ongoing support |

## The Results

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Clients onboarded | 7 (legal tech, construction, healthcare, B2B services) |
| Personalized emails sent | 25,000+ |
| Cold outreach reply rate (best) | Up to 7.12% |
| LinkedIn positive response rate | 4.17% |
| Email positive response rate | 4.29% |
| AiSDR for Archangel’s own sales | 4.18% response rate |

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Scaled outreach without adding headcount; consistent follow-ups; higher lead conversion across campaigns.
- “The flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI.” — Ricardo Mong.
- “The biggest advantage for us is the consistency AiSDR brings to our outreach.”

## Sales Use

### Best For
- Agencies running outreach for multiple clients (government, commercial, multi-industry).
- Teams that need consistency, flat cost, and clear ROI across clients.
- Proof that one platform can run 7 clients and 25K+ emails without proportional headcount.

### Key Talking Points
1. “7 clients, 25,000+ emails — no headcount growth. Consistency and flat cost for ROI.”
2. “Up to 7.12% cold reply rate; 4.17% LinkedIn positive response.”
3. “They handle all email infrastructure — domains, DNS, inboxes — so we focus on strategy.”

### Objections This Addresses
- “We run multiple clients; one tool can’t fit all.” → 7 clients, multiple industries, one platform.
- “We need to show ROI per client.” → Flat cost; easy to track expenses and calculate ROI.
- “We don’t have time to manage infrastructure.” → Full setup (domains, DNS, inboxes) by AiSDR.
