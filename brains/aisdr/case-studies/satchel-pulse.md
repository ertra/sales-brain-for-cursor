# Case Study: Satchel Pulse

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Satchel Pulse |
| **Industry** | Educational Technology (EdTech) — student well-being, school climate |
| **Products Used** | AiSDR Platform (cold outreach, reactivation, domain/inbox setup, warmup) |
| **Primary Persona** | RevOps / Revenue and Operations (Finley Berry, Revenue and Operations Team Lead) |
| **Use Case** | Cold outreach + reactivation of lost customers; niche audience; email infrastructure |

## Executive Summary

Satchel Pulse needed to build pipeline for Q4 and struggled with cold email: limited time for quality emails, a niche audience that made it risky to burn through contacts, and no email infrastructure for volume without risking the primary domain. AiSDR set up new domains and inboxes, automated cold outreach and reactivation, and managed replies. Result: **29,777 emails sent**; **2.4% overall response rate**; reactivation campaign hit **11.8% positive response rate** with replies the next day; **28% reply-to-demo rate**. Quote: “We have tried a few alternatives in this space and AiSDR is the solution that we chose. They yield results and ensure that the tool is used to its capacity.” — Finley Berry.
