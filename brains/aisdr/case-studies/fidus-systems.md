# Case Study: Fidus Systems

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Fidus Systems |
| **Industry** | Electronic design services |
| **Products Used** | AiSDR Platform (HubSpot sync, Live AI signals, enrichment, sequences) |
| **Primary Persona** | Sales Leader / Marketing (Karina Uppal, Marketing Coordinator) |
| **Use Case** | Cold outbound + event/conference waves; enterprise meetings (Siemens, Emerson, Boeing, Microsoft) |

## Executive Summary

With their SDR gone, Fidus needed to reach hardware leaders at target accounts fast. AiSDR’s two-way HubSpot sync, enrichment, and Live AI signals let them reference whitepapers and webinars in every message and run pre-/post-conference waves. Result: 9.71% positive reply rate, 18 meetings from cold outreach, 6 enterprise meetings in under 30 days, and **29.5x ROI**. Quote: “Using AiSDR delivers an ROI of approximately 29.5x. I’m very excited right now.” — Karina Uppal.

## The Customer

- **Company**: Fidus Systems — designs and builds complex electronic products (FPGA, embedded software, ASIC design, hardware layouts, signal issues).
- **Team**: Marketing (Karina Uppal, Marketing Coordinator).
- **Location**: Canada.
- **Scale**: B2B; target accounts in hardware and electronics.

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- SDR was gone; many ICP-fit leads sat idle.
- Reps focused on main deals; no tool to pull the right names and auto-reference website/webinar actions in email.
- One-size HubSpot sends felt impersonal; website visitors stayed unknown; messages lacked a personal touch.

### Key Pain Points
- No SDR → good leads went uncontacted.
- Emails couldn’t reference whitepapers or webinars.
- Lead gaps grew; website visitors unknown; messages lacked personal touch.

## The Solution

### Why They Chose AiSDR
- Two-way HubSpot sync to hit leads already in CRM; enrichment pulled fresh contacts from target-company list.
- Every message used HubSpot custom fields (e.g. whitepaper downloaded, webinar joined).
- Live AI signals for new sequences; pre-show and post-show waves around key conferences.

### Capabilities Used
| Capability | Role |
|------------|------|
| HubSpot two-way sync | Reach CRM leads with enriched, up-to-date data |
| Custom fields / enrichment | Reference whitepapers, webinars in each message |
| Live AI signals | Trigger sequences; conference waves |
| Event-based sequences | Pre- and post-conference outreach |

## The Results

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Positive reply rate | 9.71% |
| Meetings from cold outreach | 18 |
| Enterprise meetings in 30 days | 6 (Siemens, Emerson, Boeing, Microsoft) |
| ROI | 29.5x |

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Fidus keeps running new sequences (event invites, thought-leadership, demo asks); AiSDR writes and sends while sales focuses on closing.
- “The AiSDR team was genuinely helpful throughout the process. Their approach gave us confidence, and we’re happy to continue working together.” — Karina Uppal.

## Sales Use

### Best For
- Companies that lost an SDR and need to re-cover ICP leads.
- Teams with HubSpot and event/webinar/whitepaper engagement who want messages that reference that behavior.
- Electronic design, hardware, B2B engineering; enterprise targets (e.g. Siemens, Boeing, Microsoft).

### Key Talking Points
1. “29.5x ROI — Fidus replaced their SDR with AiSDR and got 18 meetings and 6 enterprise meetings in 30 days.”
2. “9.71% positive reply rate by referencing whitepapers and webinars in every message.”
3. “HubSpot sync + Live AI signals + event waves — same playbook you can run.”

### Objections This Addresses
- “We can’t afford an SDR.” → One platform doing the work; 29.5x ROI.
- “Our emails feel generic.” → Personalization from HubSpot fields and events.
- “We need enterprise meetings.” → Siemens, Emerson, Boeing, Microsoft.
