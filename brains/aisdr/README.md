Human-friendly overview of the AiSDR sales intelligence in this folder. For AI loading rules and file inventory, use `INDEX.md`.

## What This Is

This is a structured Sales Brain for **AiSDR** (AiSDR Inc.) focused on selling the AI SDR platform to revenue teams, founders, SDRs, and agencies. It captures company context, products, personas, pain points, value propositions, use cases, competitors, objections, case studies, and sales plays. All content follows the V1 contract (frontmatter, Overview, Evidence & Sources where applicable, Cross-References).

## AiSDR in One Sentence

AiSDR is an AI-powered sales development representative that fills pipelines with qualified meetings by combining intent-first targeting, research-backed messaging, and multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, optional voice/video), while positioning as “the AI that refuses to spam” and optimizing for pipeline over activity.

## Core Proof Points

| Signal | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Clients | 250+ companies |
| Meetings booked (2025) | 12,000 for clients |
| Reply rate (claimed) | 3–4x industry average; 7.1% average across campaigns |
| Meetings per 100 leads | 1–3 qualified |
| Lead-to-demo rate | 15–20% |
| ROI example | 29.5x (Fidus); $750K pipeline, 81 meetings (Classter) |
| First meeting | Often 1–2 weeks; case study: 3 days (Dry runZ) |
| Pricing | From ~$900/mo (Explore), quarterly, cancel anytime |

## Key Differentiators

1. **Pipeline over activity** — Optimizes for meetings that show up, not “messages sent”; reply rates 3–4x industry average.
2. **Intent-first targeting** — Live AI search and real-time signals; “target pain, not just profiles”; 700M+ lead database, website visitor de-anonymization.
3. **Research before every message** — No “scraping bios”; 323+ data sources; “credibility at scale.”
4. **One platform** — Replaces database, enrichment, sequencer, copy, deliverability; HubSpot and Salesforce sync; unlimited seats on plan.
5. **AI Strategist** — GTM playbook and campaign ideas in ~20 minutes; one-click launch into campaigns.
6. **Flexible terms** — Quarterly plans, cancel anytime; no long-term lock-in; “pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals.”

## Suggested Starting Points

- **If selling to founders** — Start with `personas/founder-ceo.md`, then `value-propositions/aisdr-platform-founder-ceo.md`, then `sales-plays/founder-pipeline-in-days-play.md` and `case-studies/dry-runz.md`.
- **If selling to sales leaders** — Start with `personas/sales-leader.md`, then `value-propositions/aisdr-platform-sales-leader.md`, then `sales-plays/sales-leader-pipeline-over-activity-play.md` and `case-studies/fidus-systems.md`, `case-studies/classter.md`.
- **If selling to agencies / RevOps** — Start with `personas/revops-agency-lead.md`, then `value-propositions/aisdr-platform-revops-agency-lead.md`, then `sales-plays/agency-scale-without-headcount-play.md` and `case-studies/archangel-group.md`, `case-studies/satchel-pulse.md`.
- **If handling objections** — Start with `objections/common-objections.md` (six “elephant in the room” responses), then the relevant persona objection file.
- **If comparing to 11x or others** — Start with `competitors/11x.md` and `company.md` for differentiation.

## Notes

- G2 reviews were not scraped (HTTP 403); pain points and objections are derived from aisdr.com and case studies.
- Competitor profiles for Artisan, Topo, Breeze, Unify are based on AiSDR’s comparison and web search; competitor sites were not scraped; confidence is low for those four.
- For machine-readable context loading and topic→file mapping, use `INDEX.md`.
