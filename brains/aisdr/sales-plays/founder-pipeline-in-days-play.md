# Sales Play: Founder – Pipeline in Days

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Founder – Pipeline in Days |
| **Target Persona** | Founder / CEO (often also Head of Sales) |
| **Target Company** | Startups, 2–10 or 11–50; need revenue fast; can’t wait 6+ months for inbound |
| **Products** | AiSDR Platform, AI Strategist, AI Prospecting |
| **Trigger Event** | Pipeline gap; no SDR or one generalist; “need revenue yesterday”; budget-conscious |
| **Play Type** | New logo / pipeline creation |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Founder says they need pipeline now and can’t wait for inbound
- “We can’t afford a full SDR team” or “we’re not ready to hire”
- Just lost or never had an SDR; good leads going uncontacted
- Evaluating tools after trying manual outbound or another vendor

### Ideal Customer Signals
- B2B SaaS or services; early stage or scaling
- Using or open to HubSpot (or Salesforce)
- Willing to invest ~$900/mo for pipeline if ROI is clear
- Open to quarterly commitment if they can cancel

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company size | 2–50 employees (ideal 2–10 for “work of 2–3 people”) |
| Need | First meetings in weeks, not quarters; predictable pipeline |
| Budget | Can consider ~$900/mo vs. $6k SDR or $1,8k stack |
| Readiness | Has ICP or can define with AI Strategist in ~20 min |

## The Play

### Objective
Get founder to first meeting in days and 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads without hiring an SDR, with clear ROI story (pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals) and no long-term lock-in.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
“You need revenue now and can’t wait 6 months for inbound—and you can’t afford a full SDR team. AiSDR is your AI SDR: we find prospects on intent, research every lead, and send messages that sound like you. First meeting in days—we’ve seen it in 3. One platform, ~$900/mo, unlimited seats. It’s the work of 2–3 people; pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals. Live in under a week; quarterly plans, cancel anytime.”

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Account and Champion
**Time**: 15–20 minutes
- [ ] Identify founder or co-founder who owns revenue/sales
- [ ] Confirm they need pipeline soon (next 4–8 weeks)
- [ ] Note if they have HubSpot/Salesforce or are open to it
- [ ] Check budget frame: $900/mo acceptable vs. SDR or stack

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Angle**: Speed and ROI; “first meeting in 3 days” (Dry runZ); “work of 2–3 people” (Bret Dvoracek)

**Email template (short)**:
```
Subject: First meeting in days (not months)

Hi {First Name},

Saw you’re [building X / in Y space]. Most founders can’t wait 6 months for inbound and can’t afford a full SDR team.

We help teams get first meeting in days—one customer had theirs in 3 days, 8 meetings in 30 days, fully hands-off. One platform, ~$900/mo, pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals. Quarterly, cancel anytime.

Want to see how we’d run outreach for [their space]? I can send you 5 free GTM playbooks from our AI Strategist (drop your site URL) or we do a 15-min fit call.
```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Key questions**:
1. How are you filling pipeline today—founder-led, one SDR, or nothing yet?
2. What’s the soonest you need a first meeting or first deal? What would “first meeting in 2 weeks” do for you?
3. What would an SDR or a full tool stack cost you today? How does $900/mo and one platform compare?
4. Have you tried other outreach tools? What happened?
5. Do you have a clear ICP or would you want to use our AI Strategist to get playbooks in ~20 min?

### Step 4: Demo + Pilot Design
- Show AI Strategist: drop website, get 5 GTM playbooks (no commitment)
- Show persona + one campaign flow: list → research → message → book
- Emphasize: live in 1–3 days with GTM engineer; first meeting often in 1–2 weeks; 1–3 meetings per 100 leads
- Propose Explore plan ($900/mo, quarterly); “pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals”; cancel anytime
- Offer pilot: one segment, 2–4 weeks, measure meetings and reply rate

### Step 5: Close and Launch
- Sign quarterly; no long-term lock-in
- GTM engineer onboarding; 1–3 days to first campaign
- Success metrics: first meeting within 2 weeks; 1–3 meetings per 100 leads; reply rate 3–4x industry avg

## Objection Handling

| Common objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| “This is too expensive” | “$900/mo vs. $6k SDR or $1,8k stack. Most see positive ROI in 30–60 days. Pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals. Quarterly, cancel anytime.” See [common-objections](common-objections.md). |
| “We’ve tried other tools” | “Most are fancy mail merge—volume over relevance. We get 1–3 meetings per 100 leads and 3–4x industry reply rate because we research first and don’t blast.” |
| “AI can’t sell in our niche” | “We’re built to be an industry insider. I can show you case studies in [their space] and a sample message for your ICP.” |
| “We’re not ready for outbound” | “We can start with one narrow segment and the AI Strategist playbooks—test message and audience before scaling.” |
