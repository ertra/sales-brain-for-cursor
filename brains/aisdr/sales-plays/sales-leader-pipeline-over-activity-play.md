# Sales Play: Sales Leader – Pipeline Over Activity

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Sales Leader – Pipeline Over Activity |
| **Target Persona** | VP Sales, Director of Demand Gen, Head of GTM |
| **Target Company** | Revenue teams that need pipeline without adding headcount; may have tried other AI/outreach tools |
| **Products** | AiSDR Platform, AI Prospecting, AI Strategist |
| **Trigger Event** | Tired of tools that optimize for “messages sent” and deliver 0 pipeline; tool sprawl; pipeline gap |
| **Play Type** | Competitive displacement / consolidation / new pipeline |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Pipeline target increase without proportional headcount
- Evaluation or renewal of existing outreach/AI SDR tool
- “We need more pipeline but can’t add SDRs”
- Multiple tools (database, sequencer, enrichment, copy) and unclear ROI
- Inbound leads not getting fast, personalized reply

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Already use HubSpot or Salesforce
- Measure or care about meetings and pipeline, not just activity
- Have 0 to many SDRs; may have been burned by volume-focused AI
- Open to “one platform” that replaces several point solutions

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Ownership | Owns or heavily influences pipeline and outbound strategy |
| Pain | Pipeline gap and/or tool sprawl and/or slow inbound response |
| Fit | B2B; need qualified meetings; care about deliverability and brand |
| Budget | Can consider ~$900/mo (Explore) to $2,500+ (Grow/Enterprise) vs. SDR or stack |

## The Play

### Objective
Win the sales leader by positioning AiSDR as “pipeline over activity”: 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads, reply rates 3–4x industry average, one platform replacing database + sequencer + enrichment + copy, with proof (enterprise logos, 29.5x ROI, $750K pipeline) and no long-term lock-in.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
“You need pipeline without adding headcount, and you’re tired of tools that celebrate ‘messages sent’ and deliver zero revenue. AiSDR optimizes for meetings that show up—intent-first targeting, research before every message, reply rates 3–4x industry average. One platform replaces your database, sequencer, and copy tools; everything syncs to HubSpot or Salesforce. We’ve booked 12,000 meetings for clients in 2025; 250+ companies, including Disney, Boeing, Novartis. Pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals. Quarterly, no long-term lock-in.”

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Account and Champion
**Time**: 20–30 minutes
- [ ] Identify VP Sales, Dir. Demand Gen, or Head of GTM
- [ ] Map current outbound stack (database, sequencer, enrichment, copy) and CRM
- [ ] Note pipeline target and current meeting flow; any recent tool churn
- [ ] Identify influencer (RevOps, SDR lead) if needed for evaluation

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Angle**: Pipeline and meetings, not activity; proof (Fidus 29.5x ROI, Classter $750K, enterprise logos)

**Email template (short)**:
```
Subject: Pipeline without headcount (1–3 meetings per 100 leads)

Hi {First Name},

Most outreach tools optimize for “messages sent.” You need meetings that show up.

We get 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads and reply rates 3–4x industry average—intent-first targeting, research before every message, one platform that replaces database, sequencer, and copy. Syncs to HubSpot/Salesforce. 12,000 meetings booked for clients in 2025; customers like Fidus hit 29.5x ROI and enterprise meetings (Siemens, Boeing, Microsoft).

Open to a 15-min call to see if we’re a fit for your pipeline goals?
```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Key questions**:
1. How are you filling pipeline today—SDRs, tools, or both? What’s working and what isn’t?
2. Have you tried other outreach or AI SDR tools? What happened to reply rates and deliverability?
3. How many tools touch outbound today? How much time goes into keeping them running?
4. How quickly do you respond to inbound leads? What would &lt;10 min personalized reply do for conversion?
5. What would 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads and first meeting in 1–2 weeks do for your number?

### Step 4: Demo + Proposal
- Show pipeline-over-activity positioning: “42k messages, 3 meetings, 0 pipeline” vs. AiSDR outcomes
- Show one platform: list (Live AI search or HubSpot) → research → sequence → reply → book → CRM
- Show case studies: Fidus (29.5x ROI, enterprise), Classter ($750K, 81 meetings), Dry runZ (first meeting 3 days)
- Emphasize: unlimited seats, 24/7 support, GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch; quarterly, cancel anytime
- Propose Explore or Grow based on volume; Enterprise if custom/compliance needs

### Step 5: Close and Launch
- Success metrics: 1–3 meetings per 100 leads; 15–20% lead-to-demo; reply rate 3–4x benchmark; first meeting in 1–2 weeks
- Handoff to CS/GTM engineer for onboarding; monthly or biweekly check-ins per plan

## Objection Handling

| Common objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| “We need pipeline, not more activity” | “We optimize for meetings that show up. 1–3 per 100 leads, 3–4x reply rates. Here’s Fidus: 29.5x ROI, 18 meetings, 6 enterprise in 30 days.” |
| “We need to see it work in our space” | “Case studies in pharma, legaltech, SaaS, EdTech, agencies. I’ll pull the closest to your space. We can also run a pilot on one segment.” |
| “Our stack is already complex” | “We replace multiple vendors—one platform, one subscription, HubSpot/Salesforce sync. You’re consolidating, not adding.” See [sales-leader-objections](../objections/sales-leader-objections.md). |
