# Sales Play: Agency / RevOps – Scale Outreach Without Headcount

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Agency / RevOps – Scale Outreach Without Headcount |
| **Target Persona** | RevOps Lead, Agency CEO/Founder (e.g. running outreach for multiple clients) |
| **Target Company** | Agencies running cold outreach for 3+ clients; or mid-market RevOps with multiple segments |
| **Products** | AiSDR Platform (multi-client/segment, infrastructure, GTM engineer, 24/7 support) |
| **Trigger Event** | Need to scale clients or volume without adding people; want consistency and flat cost; “tool used to capacity” |
| **Play Type** | New logo / expansion (agency or RevOps) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Agency adding new clients and can’t scale outreach proportionally
- RevOps or leadership wants one platform instead of fragmented stack
- “We’ve been burned by tools nobody actually uses”
- Need to show ROI per client or per campaign; flat cost and CRM attribution matter
- Lost leads or inconsistency across clients/segments

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Run outreach for 3+ clients (agency) or multiple segments (RevOps)
- Value “consistency” and “flat cost” for ROI
- Want onboarding and support so tool is “used to its capacity”
- Use or plan to use HubSpot/Salesforce for reporting

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Profile | Agency with 3+ outreach clients, or RevOps with multi-segment outbound |
| Pain | Scale without headcount; consistency; clear ROI; tool adoption |
| Budget | Can consider ~$900/mo (Explore) to Grow/Enterprise for volume |
| Readiness | Can define ICP per client/segment; open to 1–3 day launch with GTM engineer |

## The Play

### Objective
Win agency or RevOps by delivering one platform for multiple clients/segments, consistency and flat cost for ROI, and proof that the tool is used to capacity (onboarding, check-ins, 24/7 support). Proof: Archangel (7 clients, 25K+ emails, no headcount growth), Satchel Pulse (“used to its capacity,” 11.8% reactivation).

### Value Proposition (for this play)
“You’re running outreach for multiple clients or segments, and your stack is fragmented—constant babysitting, unclear ROI. AiSDR is one platform: list build, research, sequences, email and LinkedIn, all synced to HubSpot or Salesforce. Unlimited seats, one flat cost. Our clients run 25K+ emails across 7 clients without adding headcount; they say the biggest advantage is consistency and that the flat cost makes ROI easy to track. We get you live in 1–3 days and ensure the tool is used to its capacity—onboarding, check-ins, 24/7 support. Quarterly, cancel anytime.”

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Account and Champion
**Time**: 20–30 minutes
- [ ] Identify agency principal (CEO/Founder) or RevOps lead
- [ ] Map number of clients or segments and current volume (emails/campaigns)
- [ ] Document current stack and pain (babysitting, ROI attribution, adoption)
- [ ] Confirm need for consistency and flat cost

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Angle**: Consistency and scale without headcount; flat cost for ROI; “used to its capacity”

**Email template (short)**:
```
Subject: 7 clients, 25K+ emails, no headcount growth

Hi {First Name},

If you’re running outreach for multiple clients (or segments), consistency and ROI attribution get hard fast.

We work with agencies that run 25K+ emails across 7 clients on one platform—no headcount growth. They say the biggest advantage is consistency and that the flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI. We get you live in 1–3 days and make sure the tool is used to its capacity (onboarding, 24/7 support, check-ins).

Want to see how we’d support [X clients / your segments]?
```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Key questions**:
1. How many clients (or segments) do you run outreach for today? How do you keep quality consistent?
2. How much time does your team spend fixing integrations, cleaning lists, and troubleshooting the stack?
3. How do you attribute cost per meeting or ROI per client today? What would one invoice and one CRM view change?
4. Have previous tools been underused or shelved? What would “used to its capacity” look like for you?
5. What would adding another client or segment require today—more people or more chaos?

### Step 4: Demo + Proposal
- Show one platform: multi-persona/campaign (per client or segment), one subscription, unlimited seats
- Show CRM sync: all activity in HubSpot/Salesforce for ROI and attribution
- Show Archangel story: 7 clients, 25K+ emails, consistency, flat cost; Satchel Pulse: “used to its capacity,” support
- Emphasize: GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch; 24/7 support; monthly/biweekly check-ins so campaigns run
- Propose Explore or Grow (volume); unlimited seats so every rep/client covered

### Step 5: Close and Launch
- Success metrics: consistency across clients/segments; flat cost and clear ROI in CRM; tool adoption (campaigns live, check-ins attended)
- Handoff to GTM engineer and CSM; schedule check-ins; ensure “used to its capacity”

## Objection Handling

| Common objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| “We need consistency across clients” | “One platform for all clients. Archangel runs 7 clients, 25K+ emails; they say the biggest advantage is the consistency AiSDR brings. Unlimited seats, one workflow.” |
| “We’ve been burned by tools nobody uses” | “We’re built so the tool gets used: GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch, 24/7 support, check-ins. Satchel Pulse: ‘They yield results and ensure the tool is used to its capacity.’” |
| “We need to show ROI per client” | “One flat cost; all activity in your CRM. Archangel: ‘The flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI.’ You get reply rates, meetings, pipeline per campaign/client.” See [revops-agency-lead-objections](../objections/revops-agency-lead-objections.md). |
