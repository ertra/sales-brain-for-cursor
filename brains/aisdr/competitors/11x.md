# Competitor: 11x

## Overview

11x is an AI SDR / outreach automation platform that AiSDR positions as taking a **high-volume approach** across large TAMs, with pricing gatekept behind sales calls and less focus on lead freshness and reply autonomy. In a 90-day evaluation (third-party), 11x was rated worst-performing among 11x, Artisan, Salestools, and AiSDR, with issues including year-long lock-in, failure to manage real-time responses, and limited personalization despite significant funding. AiSDR’s comparison stresses “fundamentally different approaches”: 11x for “quickly reach thousands” and control (approve each AI response); AiSDR for precision targeting, transparent pricing, Live AI search, and reply autonomy.

## Company / Product (from AiSDR and third-party lens)

- **Positioning**: High-volume sends across large markets; “quickly reach thousands of prospects”
- **Pricing**: Not transparent; “gatekeeps pricing behind sales calls”; AiSDR claims “57% cheaper” and “10x price gap, better results”
- **Contracts**: Year-long lock-in cited in evaluation; AiSDR offers quarterly, cancel anytime
- **Differentiators (11x)**: AI phone agents for inbound call handling; WhatsApp in sequences; option to approve each AI response

## Strengths (competitor)

- **Volume**: Built for “quickly reach thousands”; large TAM focus
- **Control**: “Approve each AI response to stay in control” (option for human-in-loop)
- **Channels**: AI phone agents for inbound; WhatsApp in outreach sequences
- **Funding**: Significant venture funding (per evaluation)

## Weaknesses (AiSDR’s narrative and third-party)

- **Lead freshness**: “Pre-collected contacts that update on a schedule”; “by the time you reach out, the job title might be wrong, the timing might be off”
- **Personalization**: “Templated messaging that inserts basic details like name and company”; “messages feeling generic”; “lower engagement”
- **Reply handling**: “Managing most conversations manually”; “user reviews consistently” [cite reply/support issues]; AiSDR claims “True reply autonomy” with &lt;10 min AI response
- **Pricing**: Opaque; long lock-in (year); AiSDR positions as “57% cheaper” with “quarterly flexibility”
- **Sender reputation**: “Your sender reputation takes the hit” when leads are stale or mistimed
