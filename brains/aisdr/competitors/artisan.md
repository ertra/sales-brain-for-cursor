# Competitor: Artisan

## Overview

Artisan is an outbound-first AI sales automation platform centered on its AI BDR “Ava.” It uses a **static lead database** for sourcing and engagement and integrates with HubSpot, Salesforce, LinkedIn, and Slack. AiSDR positions itself as different on lead freshness (Live AI search vs. static DB), research-backed messaging, and transparent pricing. Artisan was included in a third-party 90-day evaluation of AI SDR platforms alongside 11x, Salestools, and AiSDR.

## Company / Product (from public and AiSDR lens)

- **Positioning**: Outbound-first; AI BDR “Ava”; automation centered on playbook and database
- **Data**: Static lead database for sourcing and engagement
- **Integrations**: HubSpot, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Slack
- **Comparison**: AiSDR blog has “Artisan vs Topo” (competitor-to-competitor comparison by AiSDR)

## Strengths (competitor)

- **AI BDR**: Named agent “Ava”; clear outbound automation story
- **Integrations**: Major CRMs and LinkedIn, Slack
- **Playbook-driven**: Customized automation (per comparison context)

## Weaknesses (AiSDR’s likely angles)

- **Static database**: AiSDR emphasizes Live AI search and “data current as of today”; Artisan’s static DB may mean staler leads and less intent-based targeting
- **Personalization**: AiSDR stresses “research before every message” and “323+ data sources”; competitors with static DB often framed as templated or less research-deep
- **Pricing / terms**: AiSDR leads with transparent pricing and quarterly flexibility; competitor terms not verified here

## AiSDR’s Differentiation vs. Artisan

| Dimension | Artisan (inferred) | AiSDR |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Lead source** | Static lead database | Live AI search; intent signals; HubSpot/Salesforce list scoring |
| **Personalization** | Playbook / automation | Research per lead; “ground-up” messages; 323+ sources |
| **Positioning** | Outbound-first, AI BDR | Full AI SDR (inbound + outbound + nurture + qualifier); pipeline over activity |
| **Pricing** | To be verified | Transparent; quarterly; cancel anytime |
