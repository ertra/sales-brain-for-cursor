# Competitor: Breeze (HubSpot)

## Overview

Breeze is HubSpot’s collection of AI sales tools (Breeze Assistant, Intelligence, Agents) that **live inside HubSpot** and pull from CRM data rather than building pipeline from scratch. AiSDR positions as a full AI SDR that builds lists (Live AI search), runs outbound and inbound, and syncs to HubSpot—whereas Breeze is HubSpot-native and enrichment-focused for existing contacts. Use case overlap: both integrate with HubSpot; AiSDR for “build pipeline from scratch” + sync; Breeze for “enrich and act on what’s already in HubSpot.”

## Company / Product (from public and AiSDR lens)

- **Vendor**: HubSpot (Breeze by HubSpot)
- **Positioning**: AI sales instruments inside HubSpot; Breeze Assistant, Intelligence, Agents
- **Data**: Pull from CRM data; “enrichment for existing contacts”; not positioned as building pipeline from scratch
- **Comparison**: AiSDR blog has “Breeze vs Unify,” “Topo vs Breeze”

## Strengths (competitor)

- **HubSpot-native**: Lives in HubSpot; no separate outbound app for HubSpot-centric teams
- **CRM-centric**: Uses existing contact and deal data; good for enrichment and in-CRM actions
- **Brand**: HubSpot trust and ecosystem; single vendor for CRM + AI tools

## Weaknesses (AiSDR’s likely angles)

- **Pipeline from scratch**: Breeze “pulls from CRM data” rather than building net-new lists; AiSDR offers Live AI search, intent signals, 700M+ database, website visitors
- **Outbound breadth**: AiSDR positions full outbound (cold list build → research → sequence → book); Breeze may be stronger for “existing contacts” and in-CRM actions
- **Reply autonomy / speed**: AiSDR stresses &lt;10 min reply and full conversation handling; Breeze capabilities to be verified

## AiSDR’s Differentiation vs. Breeze

| Dimension | Breeze (inferred) | AiSDR |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| **Place** | Inside HubSpot | Standalone platform; syncs to HubSpot (and Salesforce) |
| **Pipeline** | Enrichment, existing contacts | Build from scratch: Live AI search, intent, 700M+ DB, website visitors |
| **Use case** | CRM data, enrichment, in-CRM AI | Full outbound + inbound + nurture; list → research → message → book |
| **Pricing** | HubSpot bundle (to be verified) | Transparent; quarterly; ~$900/mo Explore |

## When to Choose Breeze

- Already all-in on HubSpot; want AI inside CRM only
- Focus on enriching and acting on existing contacts, not net-new list build
- Prefer single vendor (HubSpot) for CRM + AI

## When to Choose AiSDR

- Need to build pipeline from scratch (cold outbound, intent-based lists, website visitors)
- Want one platform for list build + research + sequences + reply autonomy; sync to HubSpot
- Want transparent pricing and quarterly flexibility independent of CRM vendor
