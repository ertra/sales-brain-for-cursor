# Competitor: Topo

## Overview

Topo is positioned as an **autonomous outbound engine** that trains on your company’s sales playbooks and ICP to match your tone and product context. AiSDR compares Topo to Artisan in a blog post (“Artisan vs Topo”) and to Breeze in another (“Topo vs Breeze”). AiSDR’s differentiation centers on Live AI search vs. static or playbook-only data, research-backed messaging, and transparent pricing with quarterly flexibility.

## Company / Product (from public and AiSDR lens)

- **Positioning**: Autonomous outbound; trains on your playbooks and ICP; matches tone and product context
- **Approach**: Playbook-driven automation; customized to business context
- **Comparison**: AiSDR blog has “Artisan vs Topo,” “Topo vs Breeze”

## Strengths (competitor)

- **Autonomy**: “Autonomous outbound engine”; less manual orchestration
- **Playbook / ICP**: Trains on your playbooks and ICP; tone and product alignment
- **Customization**: Matches your business’s tone and context

## Weaknesses (AiSDR’s likely angles)

- **Lead source / freshness**: AiSDR emphasizes Live AI search and real-time intent; Topo’s playbook training may not imply same level of “fresh list” or intent-based build
- **Research depth**: AiSDR stresses “research before every message”; differentiation vs. playbook-only personalization
- **Pricing / terms**: AiSDR leads with transparent, quarterly; competitor terms not verified
