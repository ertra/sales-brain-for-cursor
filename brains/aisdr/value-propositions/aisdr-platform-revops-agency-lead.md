# AiSDR Platform → RevOps / Agency Lead Value Proposition

## Summary

AiSDR gives RevOps and agency leads one platform for consistent, scalable outreach with predictable cost and clear ROI. Replace fragmented tools (database, sequencer, enrichment, copy, deliverability) with one subscription and unlimited seats; all activity in HubSpot or Salesforce. “Consistency AiSDR brings to our outreach” and “flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI” (Archangel Group). Scale to 25K+ emails across 7 clients without proportionally growing headcount. “Tool used to its capacity” (Satchel Pulse).

## The Problem

Fragmented stack demands constant babysitting; ROI is hard to attribute across vendors; scaling outreach (e.g. more clients) usually means adding people or dropping consistency.

## The Solution

One platform: list build, research, sequences, email + LinkedIn, deliverability, and CRM sync. Dedicated GTM engineer onboarding; 1–3 days to launch; 24/7 support; monthly or biweekly check-ins by plan. Unlimited seats so every rep or client is covered under one cost.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. One platform — no more babysitting
- **Benefit**: “You provide strategic direction and ICP. AiSDR handles the operational heavy lifting” (homepage). One subscription replaces database, sequencer, enrichment, copy, deliverability.
- **Proof point**: “A fragmented tool stack demands constant babysitting… We consolidate that workflow”; 24/7 Slack support; GTM engineer onboarding.
- **Key message**: “One intelligent system. You focus on strategy and review—we handle prospecting, research, and follow-ups.”

### 2. Flat cost, clear ROI
- **Benefit**: One invoice; unlimited seats; all activity in CRM. Easy to attribute cost per meeting or per client.

- **Key message**: “One flat cost. All activity in your CRM. Track expenses and ROI without spreadsheets.”

### 3. Scale without headcount
- **Benefit**: Run outreach for multiple clients or segments without proportionally adding people; same consistency and quality.
- **Proof point**: Archangel: “7 clients onboarded,” “25,000+ personalized emails sent,” “up to 12.7% cold outreach reply rate”; “The biggest advantage for us is the consistency AiSDR brings.”
- **Key message**: “Run outreach for 7+ clients without growing headcount. Same consistency, predictable cost.”

### 4. Tool used to its capacity
- **Benefit**: Onboarding and support so campaigns actually run and deliver—not shelved or underused.
- **Proof point**: “AiSDR is the solution that we chose. They yield results and ensure the tool is used to its capacity” (Satchel Pulse, RevOps lead); GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch; monthly/biweekly check-ins.
- **Key message**: “We ensure the tool is used to its capacity—onboarding, check-ins, and 24/7 support so campaigns run and deliver.”
