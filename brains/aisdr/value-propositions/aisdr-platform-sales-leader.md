# AiSDR Platform → Sales Leader Value Proposition

## Summary

AiSDR gives sales leaders pipeline without adding headcount—through an AI SDR that optimizes for qualified meetings and reply rates, not “messages sent.” One platform replaces database, enrichment, sequencer, and copy tools; intent-first targeting and research-backed messaging protect deliverability and brand. Reply rates 3–4x industry average; 1–3 demos per 100 leads; 12,000 meetings booked for clients in 2025. Trusted by 250+ companies and enterprise logos (Disney, Boeing, Novartis, J.P.Morgan).

## The Problem

Sales leaders are tired of AI or outreach tools that generate activity but zero pipeline—and of tool sprawl that makes ROI hard to measure. They need predictable meeting flow without linear SDR headcount, and consistent follow-up without burning domain.

## The Solution

AiSDR is the AI SDR that “refuses to spam”: it finds prospects on intent signals, researches each lead, sends personalized outreach over email and LinkedIn, qualifies replies, and books meetings. One subscription with HubSpot/Salesforce sync; unlimited seats; 24/7 support. Pipeline over activity; meetings that show up.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Pipeline over activity — meetings that show up
- **Benefit**: Predictable pipeline from outbound and inbound; no vanity metrics; focus on qualified meetings and reply rates.
- **Proof point**: “1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads”; “15–20% lead-to-demo rate”; “7.1% average reply rate across campaigns”; “3–4x higher reply rates than industry average.”
- **Key message**: “No one cares how many messages you send if they drive zero pipeline. We optimize for meetings that show up.”

### 2. Replace headcount without losing quality
- **Benefit**: “Work of 2–3 people” (customer quote); unlimited seats on plan; first meeting in 1–2 weeks.
- **Proof point**: “This is doing the work of 2–3 people right now” (Bret Dvoracek, Software Development); “2.4x revenue/client after 6 months” (About page); “Pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals.”
- **Key message**: “Pipeline without adding headcount. One platform that books meetings—pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals.”

### 3. One platform, clear ROI
- **Benefit**: Consolidate database, enrichment, sequencer, copy, deliverability; all activity in CRM; one cost to track.
- **Proof point**: Replaces Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Clay, Lemlist, Instantly, etc.; “$900/mo vs. $6k SDR or $1,800 tool stack.”
- **Key message**: “One platform instead of 10+ systems. All activity in HubSpot or Salesforce—see what drives pipeline.”

### 4. Inbound that converts — first to respond
- **Benefit**: Every inbound lead gets a unique, personalized reply in under 10 minutes; up to 78% conversion increase (platform claim).
- **Proof point**: “Inbound SDR who follows up with requests”; “3–14.5% CTR, 10–20% reply rate, 8x more pipeline.”
- **Key message**: “Be the business that responds first. Every lead gets a unique answer in under 10 minutes.”

## Quantified Value

| Metric | Before (typical) | With AiSDR | Proof |
|--------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Reply rate | &lt;1% cold email | 3–4x industry avg; 7.1% avg | About, case studies |
| Meetings per 100 leads | 0–1 | 1–3 qualified | Homepage, case studies |
| Lead-to-demo | Low | 15–20% | Pricing, platform |
| Time to first meeting | Weeks–months | 1–2 weeks | Case studies (e.g. 3 days) |
| Revenue impact | — | 2.4x revenue/client after 6 months | About page |
| ROI | — | 29.5x (Fidus case study) | Case studies |

## ROI Story

- **Pipeline**: 1–3 demos per 100 leads; 15–20% lead-to-demo; first meeting in 1–2 weeks. Case study: 29.5x ROI (Fidus); $750K pipeline, 81 meetings (Classter).
- **Cost**: ~$900/mo (Explore) vs. $6k SDR or $1,8k fragmented stack; unlimited seats; quarterly, cancel anytime. Positive ROI in 30–60 days.
- **Risk**: No long-term lock-in; deliverability and warmup handled; “AI that refuses to spam” protects domain.
