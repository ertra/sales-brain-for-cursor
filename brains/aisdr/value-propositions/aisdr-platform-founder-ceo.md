# AiSDR Platform → Founder / CEO Value Proposition

## Summary

AiSDR gives founders revenue speed without a full SDR team: first meeting in days, 1–3 qualified demos per 100 leads, and one platform from list build to booked meeting. ~$900/mo vs. $6k SDR or $1,8k tool stack; “work of 2–3 people”; pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals. Live in under a week; some clients see results within the first 50 messages. No long-term lock-in.

## The Problem

Founders need pipeline now but can’t wait 6+ months for inbound and often can’t afford a top-of-funnel team. Manual outbound doesn’t scale; they fear burning domain or sounding like a bot.

## The Solution

AiSDR is the AI SDR that does research and outreach in your voice—intent-first targeting, personalized messages, qualification, and meeting booking. GTM engineer onboarding; launch in 1–3 days. AI Strategist gives campaign ideas in ~20 minutes. One flat cost; positive ROI in 30–60 days.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Revenue yesterday — first meeting in days
- **Benefit**: Don’t wait for inbound; get first meeting in 1–2 weeks (case study: 3 days since launch).
- **Proof point**: “Some clients see results within the first 50 messages”; “First meeting in 3 days” (Dry runZ); “In 30 days, Dry runZ secured 8 meetings. Fully hands-off.”
- **Key message**: “Revenue yesterday, not next quarter. First meeting in days—we’ve seen it in 3.”

### 2. Work of 2–3 people, one subscription
- **Benefit**: No need to hire SDRs; one platform does list → research → message → qualify → book.
- **Proof point**: “We cannot afford a top-of-funnel outbound team… This is doing the work of 2–3 people right now” (Bret Dvoracek); unlimited seats on plan.
- **Key message**: “Full team of sales people AND research assistants. One subscription—pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals.”

### 3. Sensible budget — clear ROI
- **Benefit**: ~$900/mo (Explore) vs. $6k SDR or $1,8k fragmented stack; quarterly, cancel anytime; positive ROI in 30–60 days.
- **Proof point**: “AiSDR pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals”; “29.5x ROI” (Fidus); “campaign produced an open deal around CA$394K” (Karina Uppal).
- **Key message**: “$900/mo. Positive ROI in 30–60 days. No long-term lock-in.”

### 4. Scale without burning domain
- **Benefit**: Research before every message; “AI that refuses to spam”; only outreach when there’s a verifiable reason; deliverability and warmup handled.
- **Proof point**: “Reply rates 3–4x higher than industry average”; “Generic AI can’t. AiSDR is built to be an industry insider.”
- **Key message**: “Your domain and brand stay protected. We only reach out when there’s a reason to talk.”
