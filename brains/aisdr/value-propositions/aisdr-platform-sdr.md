# AiSDR Platform → SDR Value Proposition

## Summary

AiSDR gives SDRs one platform for end-to-end outreach: list build, research, sequences, email + LinkedIn, replies in 5–10 minutes, and CRM sync. “Get outbound right the first time”—launch campaigns in 30–60 minutes with 323+ data sources and 50+ frameworks. Save 35%+ time; every message research-backed, not “scraping bios.” All activity in HubSpot or Salesforce.

## The Problem

SDRs juggle multiple tools (database, enrichment, sequencer, copy); spend 20+ minutes per contact on research and email prep; and struggle to respond to inbound fast or personalize at scale without burning domain.

## The Solution

One platform: live AI search and intent signals for lists; AI research per lead; persona and sequence builder; email, LinkedIn, optional Aircall; auto-replies in 5–10 min; objection handling and meeting booking. HubSpot/Salesforce sync. “All features under one roof” (customer quote).

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. One platform — launch in 30–60 minutes
- **Benefit**: No more juggling five tools; one place for list → research → message → follow-up → book.
- **Proof point**: “All the features I need to cover the outbound process from end to end is under one roof making it easy to spin up and launch new campaigns in 30-60 minutes” (Daniil Kopilevych).
- **Key message**: “End-to-end outreach in one platform. Launch new campaigns in 30–60 minutes.”

### 2. Research and personalization at scale
- **Benefit**: AI researches each lead (LinkedIn, company, industry); “302% more personalization”; “100% unique”; no “scraping bios.” Save 35%+ time.
- **Proof point**: “323+ data sources”; “50+ built-in sales frameworks”; “20 minutes per contact” → automated; “96.6x faster outreach” (nurturing claim).
- **Key message**: “Every message shows relevance. AI does the research—you get consistency and scale.”

### 3. Reply in 5–10 minutes — nothing slips
- **Benefit**: Inbound and replies get unique, personalized response in 5–10 minutes; follow-ups automated; “first to respond” advantage.
- **Proof point**: “Increases your conversion up to 78% by sending every inbound lead a unique answer in under 10 minutes”; “Replies in 5–10 min or co-pilot mode.”
- **Key message**: “Reply in 5–10 minutes, every time. Automate follow-ups so nothing slips.”

### 4. Credibility at scale — protect your domain
- **Benefit**: Research before every message; intent-first targeting; warmup and deliverability; reply rates 3–4x industry average.
- **Proof point**: “We don’t scrape LinkedIn bios and call it personalization”; “Credibility at scale”; “95% deliverability rate” (outbound claim).
- **Key message**: “We don’t scrape bios. Every message proves we did our homework—your domain stays protected.”
