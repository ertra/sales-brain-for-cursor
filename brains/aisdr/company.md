# AiSDR

## Overview

AiSDR is an AI-powered sales development representative (AI SDR) that fills sales pipelines with qualified meetings. The platform focuses on **lead quality over volume**: it finds prospects in real time across the web based on buyer signals you define, researches each lead (LinkedIn, company news, industry context), and sends deeply researched outreach over email, LinkedIn, and other channels. The AI qualifies replies, handles common objections, and books meetings when prospects are ready—positioned as “your best rep with radar” that won’t spam or burn your domain.

**Company**: AiSDR Inc.  
**Website**: https://aisdr.com/  
**Headquarters**: San Francisco, CA (2261 Market St).

**Product pillars**: (1) **Intent-first targeting** — Live AI search and signal-based list building (plus HubSpot/Salesforce list scoring). (2) **Research-backed messaging** — No “scraping bios”; research before every message. (3) **AI Strategist** — GTM campaign ideas (ICP, audience, signals, messaging, sequence) in ~20 minutes via conversation. (4) **Adaptable sequences** — Multi-channel, multimedia (video, memes, voice notes), rules based on lead behavior. (5) **Pipeline over activity** — Optimizes for meetings that show up; typical claims: 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads, 15–20% lead-to-demo rate, first meeting often in 1–2 weeks.

**Positioning**: “Meet your AI that refuses to spam.” Contrasts with volume-focused tools; emphasizes credibility, deliverability, and reply rates “3–4x higher than industry average.” Built for revenue teams that need pipeline without adding headcount, founders who need revenue quickly, and sales leaders tired of AI activity that doesn’t convert. Not for “blast entire TAM,” “set and forget,” or success measured in emails sent.

**Integrations**: HubSpot, Salesforce (contacts, enrichment, scoring, activity sync); Aircall (calls + AI insights). Replaces or consolidates tools like Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Clay, Lemlist, Instantly, etc.

**Pricing**: Quarterly plans from ~$900/mo (billed quarterly), unlimited seats, all features, 24/7 support; message and lead-search credits; no long-term lock-in.
