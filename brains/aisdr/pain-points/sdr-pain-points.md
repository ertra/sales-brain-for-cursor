# SDR – Pain Points

## Overview

SDRs spend most of their day on prospecting, list cleaning, research, and follow-ups—with multiple tools that don’t talk to each other. They struggle to balance personalization and volume, respond to inbound fast, and “get outbound right the first time” without burning domain or sounding generic.

## Pain Points

### 1. Tool sprawl: database, enrichment, sequencer, deliverability—hard to keep in sync
- **Description**: Separate tools for leads, enrichment, sequences, copy, bounce checking; data and workflows fragmented; constant context-switching and maintenance.
- **Impact**: Time lost on ops; inconsistent data; campaigns break when one tool fails or integrates change.
- **Current solutions**: Manual exports/imports, spreadsheets, or living with the chaos.
- **Frequency**: Daily.
- **Severity**: High
- **Product solution**: AiSDR: one platform for list build, research, sequences, email + LinkedIn, deliverability; HubSpot/Salesforce sync; “all features under one roof” (customer quote).
- **Key message**: “One platform for end-to-end outreach. Launch new campaigns in 30–60 minutes—no juggling five tools.”

### 2. Manual research per lead limits volume and consistency
- **Description**: “20 minutes per contact on research and email prep” (customer quote); can’t personalize at scale; either generic (low reply) or high-touch (low volume).
- **Impact**: SDR capacity capped; reply rates or volume suffer; 70% of day on “grunt work” (AiSDR positioning).
- **Current solutions**: Templates with light customization, or accept lower volume.
- **Frequency**: Daily.
- **Severity**: High
- **Product solution**: AI researches each lead (LinkedIn, company, industry); “323+ data sources”; “302% more personalization”; “100% unique”; no “scraping bios.”
- **Key message**: “Every message shows relevance. AI does the research—you get consistency and scale. Save 35%+ more time.”

### 3. Slow or inconsistent response to inbound; follow-ups slip
- **Description**: Inbound leads wait hours or days for a reply; follow-up sequences are manual or rigid; “first to respond” advantage is lost.
- **Impact**: Lower conversion from inbound; leads go cold; SDR overwhelmed by inbox and sequences.
- **Current solutions**: Manual replies, simple auto-responders, or triage that drops leads.
- **Frequency**: Daily.
- **Severity**: High
- **Product solution**: AiSDR replies in 5–10 minutes; unique answer per lead; handles questions and objections; email, SMS, LinkedIn; up to 78% conversion increase (platform claim).
- **Key message**: “Reply in 5–10 minutes, every time. Automate follow-ups and replies so nothing slips.”

### 4. Fear of sounding generic or burning domain
- **Description**: Pressure to hit activity numbers without burning domain; “personalization at scale” often means merge fields, not real relevance.
- **Impact**: Low reply rates; deliverability issues; frustration that “personalization” doesn’t work.
- **Current solutions**: Send less, or accept lower performance.
- **Frequency**: When sending volume or evaluating tools.
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product solution**: Research before every message; intent-first targeting; warmup and mailbox management; “credibility at scale”; reply rates “3–4x higher than industry average.”
- **Key message**: “We don’t scrape bios and call it personalization. Every message proves we did our homework.”

## Discovery Questions

1. How many tools do you use today for outbound (database, enrichment, sequencer, etc.)? How much time goes to moving data and fixing issues?
2. How much time do you spend per lead on research and writing? What would you do with that time if it were automated?
3. How fast do you respond to inbound leads today? What would 5–10 minute personalized replies do for your conversion?
4. Have you had deliverability or “sounding like a bot” issues? How do you balance volume and relevance today?
