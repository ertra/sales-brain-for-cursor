# RevOps / Agency Lead – Pain Points

## Overview

RevOps and agency leads run or support outbound for one or many clients. They struggle with fragmented tools that need constant babysitting, unclear ROI across the stack, and scaling outreach (e.g. 25K+ emails for 7 clients) without proportionally growing headcount. They want consistency, flat cost, and “tool used to its capacity.”

## Pain Points

### 1. Fragmented stack demands constant babysitting
- **Description**: “A fragmented tool stack demands constant babysitting: fixing integrations, cleaning lists, and troubleshooting” (homepage). Multiple tools for database, sequencer, enrichment, deliverability—each can break or drift.
- **Impact**: Ops time instead of strategy; campaigns stall; team and clients frustrated.
- **Current solutions**: Dedicated ops time, or accept instability.
- **Frequency**: Daily / weekly.
- **Severity**: High
- **Product solution**: AiSDR consolidates workflow; “you provide strategic direction and ICP, AiSDR handles operational heavy lifting”; 24/7 support; GTM engineer onboarding; turnkey email setup.
- **Key message**: “One intelligent system. You spend time on strategy and review—we handle prospecting, research, and follow-ups.”

### 2. Hard to track ROI when tools are scattered
- **Description**: Cost and results spread across many vendors; unclear which tool drives meetings or pipeline; “flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI” (Archangel Group quote).
- **Impact**: Can’t prove value to leadership or clients; budget decisions are guesswork.
- **Current solutions**: Spreadsheets, rough attribution, or accepting opacity.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / quarterly.
- **Severity**: High
- **Product solution**: One subscription (Explore/Grow/Enterprise); unlimited seats; all activity in HubSpot/Salesforce; clear cost per plan and message/lead credits.
- **Key message**: “One flat cost. All activity in your CRM. Calculate ROI and cost per meeting without spreadsheets.”

### 3. Scaling outreach across clients without growing headcount
- **Description**: Agency runs outreach for 7+ clients (e.g. Archangel: 25,000+ emails, legaltech, construction, healthcare); adding clients usually means adding people or dropping quality.
- **Impact**: Revenue ceiling; margin pressure; inconsistency across clients.
- **Current solutions**: Hire more SDRs or ops; limit number of clients; use generic playbooks.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (growth).
- **Severity**: High
- **Product solution**: One platform for many clients; configurable personas and campaigns per client; “consistency AiSDR brings to our outreach” (Archangel); up to 12.7% cold reply rate in case study.
- **Key message**: “Run outreach for multiple clients without proportionally growing headcount. Same consistency, predictable cost.”

### 4. Tools not “used to capacity”
- **Description**: “We have tried a few alternatives… AiSDR is the solution that we chose. They yield results and ensure the tool is used to its capacity” (Satchel Pulse, RevOps lead). Other tools underused or overcomplicated.
- **Impact**: Wasted spend; teams fall back to manual; leadership questions tool investment.
- **Current solutions**: More training, or switch vendors.
- **Frequency**: When evaluating or renewing.
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product solution**: Dedicated GTM engineer onboarding; 1–3 days to launch; monthly/biweekly check-ins (by plan); 24/7 Slack support; AI Strategist so campaigns are built and launched, not shelved.
- **Key message**: “We ensure the tool is used to its capacity—onboarding, check-ins, and support so campaigns run and deliver.”

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain point | Severity | Frequency | Our solution | Key message |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fragmented stack, babysitting | High | Daily/Weekly | One platform; 24/7 support | “We handle the heavy lifting” |
| Unclear ROI | High | Monthly/Quarterly | Flat cost; CRM sync | “Track expenses and ROI” |
| Scale without headcount | High | Ongoing | Multi-client; consistency | “25K+ emails, 7 clients” |
| Tool not used to capacity | Medium–High | Evaluation | Onboarding; check-ins; support | “Used to its capacity” |

## Discovery Questions

1. How much time does your team spend fixing integrations, cleaning lists, and troubleshooting the current stack?
2. How do you today attribute cost per meeting or ROI across database, sequencer, enrichment, etc.?
3. If you add another client or segment, do you add people? What would one platform that handles all outreach mean for margin?
4. Are your current tools fully used—or do people work around them? What would “used to its capacity” look like?
