# SDR (Sales Development Representative)

## Overview

SDRs who run outbound (and often support inbound) day to day. They are a fit for AiSDR when they want to “get outbound right the first time”: one platform for prospecting, research, sequences, and replies, with personalization and speed without living in LinkedIn or manually researching every lead.

## Role/Title

SDR, Sales Development Representative, BDR, Inside Sales Rep. Executes cold outbound, inbound follow-up, and sometimes nurturing; hands off qualified meetings to AEs.

## Responsibilities

- Build lists, research leads, write and send personalized outreach (email, LinkedIn)
- Run sequences and follow-ups; respond to replies and objections; book meetings
- Hit activity and meeting targets; keep CRM updated (HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Often spend 70% of day on “grunt work” (prospecting, list cleaning, research, follow-ups) per AiSDR positioning

## Company Profile

Companies with one or more SDRs; use HubSpot or Salesforce; may use multiple tools (database, enrichment, sequencer, copy). Industries: SaaS, services, agencies, etc.

## Key Problems & Pain Points

- Tool sprawl: database, enrichment, sequencer, deliverability—hard to keep in sync and maintain
- Manual research per lead (e.g. “20 minutes per contact on research and email prep”) limits volume and consistency
- Balancing personalization and volume; fear of sounding generic or burning domain
- Slow response to inbound leads; follow-ups slip

## Goals & Objectives

- One platform for end-to-end outbound: list → research → message → follow-up → book
- “Get outbound right the first time”; launch campaigns in 30–60 minutes
- Personalization at scale (323+ data sources, 50+ frameworks) without manual research per lead
- Reply in 5–10 minutes; 35%+ time saved (AiSDR claim)

## How AiSDR Solves Their Problems

- **End-to-end**: Prospecting (live AI search, intent signals), persona and sequences, email + LinkedIn (+ optional Aircall); all activity to CRM
- **Research and personalization**: AI researches each lead; “302% more personalization,” “100% unique”; no “scraping bios”
- **Speed**: Persona set-up 5–10 min; launch campaign 30–60 min; replies in 5–10 min or co-pilot
- **Tasks AiSDR is “trained to help with”** (use-case page): book meetings, de-anonymize visitors, LinkedIn connection requests and DMs, qualifying questions, respond to demo requests, objections, pricing, sales enablement, route complex questions, process auto-replies

## Buying Process

- Often user and influencer; champion may be Sales Leader or RevOps
- Cares about ease of use, one place for everything, and not “dropping the ball or hallucinating” on tricky questions (route to human)
- Convinced by “all features under one roof,” launch speed, and testimonials from SDRs (“booked a call for me on the first day”)

## Communication Preferences

- Outcomes: meetings booked, reply rates, time saved, consistency
- Proof: 1–3 meetings per 100 leads, 68% open rate (nurturing), “booked a call on first day” (testimonial)
- Features: persona builder, omnichannel sequences, 50+ frameworks, HubSpot/Salesforce sync, Aircall
