# RevOps / Agency Lead

## Overview

Revenue Operations leads and agency principals (CEO, Ops) who run or support GTM tooling and outreach for one company or many. They are a fit for AiSDR when they want one platform for consistency, predictable cost, and ROI across outbound—and when they value “human judgment where it matters” (AI handles execution; humans close and decide).

## Role/Title

Revenue and Operations Team Lead, RevOps, Head of GTM Operations, CEO/Founder of agency running outreach for clients. Owns or heavily influences tool selection, process consistency, and cost/ROI of outbound.

## Responsibilities

- Select and manage sales tech stack; ensure tools are used to capacity and deliver ROI
- Run or oversee outreach for multiple segments or clients (agencies); track cost per meeting, reply rates, pipeline
- Balance consistency (same process, same quality) with flexibility (different campaigns, industries)
- Support SDRs and sales leaders with reporting, onboarding, and best practices

## Company Profile

- **In-house**: Mid-market or scaling company with RevOps function; multiple campaigns or segments
- **Agency**: Consultancy or agency running cold outreach for 7+ clients (e.g. Archangel Group); industries like legaltech, construction, healthcare

## Key Problems & Pain Points

- Fragmented stack: database, enrichment, sequencer, deliverability—constant babysitting and troubleshooting
- Hard to track ROI when tools are scattered; “flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI” (agency quote)
- Need consistency across clients or segments without growing headcount proportionally
- Want AI to handle execution but keep human judgment for strategy and complex conversations

## Goals & Objectives

- One platform that “yields results and ensures the tool is used to its capacity” (Satchel Pulse quote)
- Predictable cost and clear ROI; easy to calculate cost per meeting or per client
- Scale outreach (e.g. 25K+ emails across 7 clients) without proportionally adding people
- “Consistency AiSDR brings to our outreach” (Archangel Group)

## How AiSDR Solves Their Problems

- **Consolidation**: Replaces lead database, sequencer, enrichment, copy, deliverability tools; one subscription, unlimited seats on plan
- **Consistency**: Same persona and sequence logic across campaigns; configurable per segment/client; 24/7 support and monthly or biweekly check-ins (by plan)
- **ROI and cost**: Quarterly pricing, flat cost per plan; case studies with reply rates (e.g. up to 12.7% cold outreach, 28% reply-to-demo)
- **Scale**: Agency case study: 7 clients, 25,000+ emails, no headcount growth

## Buying Process

- Often evaluator and influencer; may need to align Sales Leader and Finance
- Cares about total cost of ownership, ease of onboarding (GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch), and proof that the tool is “used to its capacity”
- Compares to cost of multiple point solutions and time spent maintaining them

## Communication Preferences

- Outcomes: consistency, ROI, cost per meeting, reply rates, “used to its capacity”
- Proof: agency and scale case studies (Archangel Group, Satchel Pulse), flat cost, one platform
- Operations: onboarding, 24/7 support, check-ins, HubSpot/Salesforce sync
