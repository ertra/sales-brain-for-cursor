# Founder / CEO

## Overview

Founders and CEOs who need revenue quickly and can’t wait 6+ months for inbound. They are a strong fit for AiSDR when they can’t afford a full SDR team but need predictable outbound that sounds human and books meetings. They value speed to first meeting and clear ROI.

## Role/Title

Founder, CEO, Co-Founder (often also Head of Sales in early stage). Owns revenue and growth; may be the one running or approving first outbound efforts.

## Responsibilities

- Grow revenue; decide how to invest in sales (hire vs. tool)
- Get first or early customers; shorten time to first meeting and first deal
- Balance budget: R&D, marketing, and sales; often “can’t afford a top-of-funnel outbound team” (customer quote)

## Company Profile

Startups and small teams (e.g. 2–10, 11–50); B2B SaaS, services, or product companies. May have no SDR or one generalist; often use a CRM (HubSpot common).

## Key Problems & Pain Points

- Need pipeline now; inbound takes too long to ramp
- Can’t justify $6k/mo SDR or a $1,800/mo tool stack
- Manual outbound doesn’t scale; don’t have time to research every lead and write every email
- Fear of burning domain or sounding like a bot

## Goals & Objectives

- First meeting in days to ~2 weeks; 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads
- “Work of 2–3 people” without hiring (customer quote); positive ROI in 30–60 days
- One tool that does list → research → outreach → book; minimal ongoing management
- AiSDR “pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals”

## How AiSDR Solves Their Problems

- **Speed**: Live in under a week; some clients see results within first 50 messages; first meeting in 3 days (case study)
- **Cost**: ~$900/mo (Explore) vs. SDR or multi-tool stack; quarterly, cancel anytime
- **Done-for-you**: GTM engineer onboarding, turnkey email setup, AI Strategist for campaign ideas in ~20 minutes
- **Quality**: Research-backed messages, qualification, and meeting booking so founder doesn’t waste time on bad-fit leads

## Buying Process

- Often sole or primary decision-maker; may involve co-founder or first sales hire
- Sensitive to price and contract length; quarterly with no long-term lock-in is a plus
- Convinced by ROI narrative, case studies (e.g. “first meeting in 3 days,” “doing work of 2–3 people”), and try-before-commit (demo, AI Strategist free playbooks)

## Communication Preferences

- Outcomes: first meeting fast, meetings per 100 leads, ROI (e.g. 29.5x in case study), “pays for itself”
- Proof: startup case studies (Dry runZ, Xcela, Mary Technology, Eber), flat cost, no headcount
- Simplicity: set up in 1–3 days, launch campaign in 30–60 min, low maintenance
