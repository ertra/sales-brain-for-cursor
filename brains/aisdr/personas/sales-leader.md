# Sales Leader

## Overview

Sales leaders (VP Sales, Director of Demand Generation, Head of GTM) who own pipeline and team performance. They are a primary fit for AiSDR when they are tired of AI or outreach tools that generate activity but zero revenue, and want pipeline without adding headcount. They care about qualified meetings and reply rates, not “emails sent.”

## Role/Title

VP Sales, Director of Demand Generation, Head of GTM, Sales Director. Owns or heavily influences pipeline targets, SDR/outbound strategy, and tooling decisions.

## Responsibilities

- Hit pipeline and revenue targets; ensure predictable meeting flow for AEs
- Decide or approve outbound strategy, tool stack (CRM, sequencer, database, enrichment)
- Balance cost of SDR headcount vs. tools; protect domain reputation and deliverability
- Evaluate AI and automation: want results (meetings, pipeline), not vanity metrics

## Company Profile

Revenue teams at SMB to enterprise; often already use HubSpot or Salesforce. May have 0 to many SDRs; may have tried other outreach or AI SDR tools and been disappointed.

## Key Problems & Pain Points

- AI or outreach tools that optimize for “messages sent” and burn domain or deliver no pipeline
- Need more pipeline but can’t or don’t want to add SDR headcount
- Tool sprawl: database, enrichment, sequencer, copy tools—hard to maintain and measure ROI
- Inconsistent follow-up and slow response to inbound leads

## Goals & Objectives

- Predictable pipeline from outbound and/or inbound without linear headcount growth
- One platform that handles list → research → message → qualify → book meeting
- Reply rates and meetings that show up; deliverability and brand protected
- Clear ROI: cost per meeting, pipeline generated; “3–4x higher reply rates than industry average” resonates

## How AiSDR Solves Their Problems

- **Pipeline over activity**: 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads, 15–20% lead-to-demo rate; first meeting in 1–2 weeks
- **Single platform**: Replaces database, enrichment, sequencer, copy tools; integrates with HubSpot/Salesforce
- **Quality and deliverability**: Intent-first targeting, research before every message, warmup and mailbox management
- **Proof**: Case studies with named enterprises (Disney, Boeing, Novartis, etc.); 12,000 meetings booked for clients in 2025

## Buying Process

- Often champion or final approver; may involve RevOps for tooling and Finance for budget
- Cares about demo quality (“3 WOW moments on average per demo”), case studies, and clear pricing (quarterly, no long-term lock-in)
- May compare to cost of SDR ($6k/mo) or fragmented stack ($1,800/mo); ROI in 30–60 days, pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals

## Communication Preferences

- Outcomes: pipeline, meetings booked, reply rates, time to first meeting
- Proof: case studies, enterprise logos, 7.1% average reply rate, 2.4x revenue/client after 6 months
- Contrast: “AI that refuses to spam” vs. volume tools; lead quality over volume
