# SDR – Objection Handling

## Overview

Objections from SDRs evaluating AiSDR. Focus on “another tool to learn,” “AI will replace me,” and “our process is too custom.” Use [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for cost, “already have SDRs,” “tried other tools,” spam, and “no time to manage.” Below: adoption and control.

## Objections

### 1. “I don’t want another tool to learn—we already have five”

**Why they say this**:  
Tool fatigue; context-switching; “one more login, one more workflow.”

**Acknowledge**:  
“Too many tools is a real pain.”

**Respond**:  
“AiSDR is built to replace several of them, not add one more. One platform for list build, research, sequences, email and LinkedIn, and replies—all in one place. Launch new campaigns in 30–60 minutes. Your reps save 35%+ more time because they’re not moving data between database, enrichment, and sequencer. One login, one workflow, everything syncs to HubSpot or Salesforce. So you’re consolidating, not adding. We get you live in 1–3 days with a GTM engineer so you’re not left to figure it out alone.”

**Proof point**:  
- “All the features I need… under one roof… spin up and launch new campaigns in 30-60 minutes” (Daniil Kopilevych)  
- “35%+ more time”; “We consolidate that workflow” (homepage, platform)  
- Replaces Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Clay, Lemlist, Instantly (pricing)

**Follow-up question**:  
“Which of your current tools would you drop if one did list, research, sequence, and reply? We can map that.”

### 2. “Will this replace me / make me redundant?”

**Why they say this**:  
Fear of job loss; “AI SDR” sounds like replacement.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Your role is valuable. We’re not here to replace you.”

**Respond**:  
“We automate the grunt work—70% of an SDR’s day is prospecting, list cleaning, research, manual follow-ups. AiSDR does that so you focus on conversations that drive revenue: the leads who reply, the nuanced objections, the handoff to AEs. Our customers say things like ‘booked a call for me on the first day’—you’re still the one closing the conversation and building the relationship. We’re your research and follow-up engine; you’re the one who shows up on the call and wins the deal. Think of it as 2–3 people’s worth of research and outreach so you can be in more of the right conversations.”

**Proof point**:  
- “70% of day on grunt work”; “35%+ more time” for reps (platform, homepage)  
- “Perfect. Keep them.” (elephant: “We already have SDRs”)  
- “This is doing the work of 2–3 people right now” (Bret Dvoracek); “booked a call for me on the first day” (Nelly W.)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What would you do with 35%+ of your time back—more campaigns, or more focus on replying and closing?”

### 3. “Our process is too custom; a tool won’t fit”

**Why they say this**:  
Unique segments, messaging, or approval flows; “we’re different.”

**Acknowledge**:  
“Every team has their own way of selling.”

**Respond**:  
“AiSDR is built for that. You define the persona—ICP, pains, value props, writing style. You can drop a link to your website and have the AI learn your voice. We have 50+ outreach frameworks and configurable follow-up rules; you choose the channels (email, LinkedIn, optional voice notes and video) and the sequence. If you need handoff rules—e.g. route certain questions to you—you set that. We’re not a rigid template; we’re a configurable engine that runs in your voice. I can show you a campaign that mirrors how you’d want to run it.”

**Proof point**:  
- “Persona builder”; “Target ICP, pains, value props”; “drop a link to your website and have the AI do the rest” (features)  
- “50+ built-in sales frameworks”; “Configurable omnichannel sequences with unlimited touchpoints” (platform, pricing)  
- “Route questions it can’t answer to you” (use cases); handoff rules (vs 11x page)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What’s the one thing that has to be custom in your process—messaging, approval, or channels? We can map that first.”
