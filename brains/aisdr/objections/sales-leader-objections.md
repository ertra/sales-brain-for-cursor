# Sales Leader – Objection Handling

## Overview

Objections from sales leaders (VP Sales, Director of Demand Gen, Head of GTM) evaluating AiSDR. Focus on pipeline vs. activity, headcount, tool sprawl, and past tool failure. Use [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for cost, “already have SDRs,” “tried other tools,” spam, and time. Below: pipeline/ROI and “we need to see it work first.”

## Objections

### 1. “We need pipeline, not more activity”

**Why they say this**:  
Been burned by tools that celebrate sends and don’t move revenue; want meetings and pipeline, not vanity metrics.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Pipeline over activity is exactly how we think.”

**Respond**:  
“We optimize for meetings that show up, not messages sent. 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads; 15–20% lead-to-demo rate; first meeting in 1–2 weeks. We don’t blast—we use intent signals and research before every message. Reply rates are 3–4x industry average because we’re not burning your domain. I can show you case studies with pipeline numbers: 29.5x ROI, $750K pipeline, 81 meetings, enterprise logos. We’re built for leaders who are tired of AI that doesn’t convert.”

**Proof point**:  
- “Pipeline over activity”; “1–3 meetings per 100 leads”; “12,000 meetings booked for clients in 2025”  
- Fidus 29.5x ROI; Classter $750K pipeline, 81 meetings; Disney, Boeing, Novartis (homepage)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What are you measuring today—emails sent or meetings and pipeline? How would 1–3 meetings per 100 leads change your number?”

### 2. “We need to see it work in our space first”

**Why they say this**:  
Skepticism; want proof in their industry or segment before committing.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Proof in your space matters.”

**Respond**:  
“We have case studies across SaaS, pharma, legaltech, healthcare, agencies, EdTech, finance. I can pull ones closest to your space. We also offer a demo where you see the AI write an email to you—and you can try the AI Strategist with your website and get 5 free GTM playbooks. No commitment. If you want a pilot, we get you live in 1–3 days; many customers see results in the first 50 messages. We can start with one segment and prove reply rate and meetings before you scale.”

**Proof point**:  
- Case studies by industry (Medisafe pharma, Archangel legaltech/construction/healthcare, Fidus enterprise, etc.)  
- “Some clients see results within the first 50 messages”; “First meeting in 3 days” (Dry runZ)  
- AI Strategist: “Get 5 free tailored GTM campaign ideas”; “See how AiSDR will sell to you”

**Follow-up question**:  
“Which segment would you want to pilot first—and what would ‘proof’ look like for you: reply rate, meetings booked, or pipeline?”

### 3. “Our stack is already complex; we can’t add another vendor”

**Why they say this**:  
Too many tools; procurement and ops fatigue; “one more integration to maintain.”

**Acknowledge**:  
“Stack complexity is a real issue.”

**Respond**:  
“AiSDR replaces multiple vendors—database, enrichment, sequencer, copy, deliverability—so you’re consolidating, not adding. One subscription, HubSpot or Salesforce sync, 24/7 support. Your team gets one platform and one place to see what’s driving pipeline. We onboard you in 1–3 days with a GTM engineer so you’re not left to figure it out. Many customers say the biggest win is ‘one platform instead of 10+ systems.’ Want to map what you’d retire vs. what we replace?”

**Proof point**:  
- “Replaces Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Clay, Lemlist, Instantly…” (pricing, value props)  
- “One platform instead of 10+ systems”; “We consolidate that workflow” (homepage)  
- GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch; 24/7 support (pricing, platform)

**Follow-up question**:  
“How many tools touch outbound today? Which would you drop if one platform did list, research, sequence, and reply?”
