# RevOps / Agency Lead – Objection Handling

## Overview

Objections from RevOps and agency leads evaluating AiSDR. Focus on stack consolidation, ROI attribution, and “tool not used to capacity.” Use [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for cost, “tried other tools,” “spam cannon,” and “no time to manage.” Below: consistency across clients and proving ROI.

## Objections

### 1. “We need consistency across clients—one tool for everyone”

**Why they say this**:  
Agency runs outreach for multiple clients; need same quality and process; avoid client-specific tool chaos.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Consistency across clients is key.”

**Respond**:  
“AiSDR is one platform for all your clients. You create a persona and campaign per client—same workflow, same quality, configurable per segment. Our customers run 25K+ emails across 7 clients without adding headcount; they say the biggest advantage is the consistency AiSDR brings. Unlimited seats on the plan, so every rep or client is covered under one subscription. One flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI per client. We get you live in 1–3 days and have check-ins so the tool is used to its capacity.”

**Proof point**:  
- Archangel Group: “7 clients,” “25,000+ personalized emails,” “the biggest advantage for us is the consistency AiSDR brings,” “flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI”  
- “Unlimited seats”; “one platform” (pricing, value props)  
- “Used to its capacity” (Satchel Pulse, RevOps lead)

**Follow-up question**:  
“How many clients do you run outreach for today, and how do you keep quality consistent? What would one platform and one cost model change?”

### 2. “We’ve been burned by tools that nobody actually uses”

**Why they say this**:  
Previous tools underused or shelved; “tool not used to capacity” is a real concern.

**Acknowledge**:  
“If the tool sits on the shelf, it’s wasted spend.”

**Respond**:  
“We’re built so the tool gets used. Dedicated GTM engineer onboarding; you’re live in 1–3 days. We have 24/7 support and monthly or biweekly check-ins so campaigns run and we catch issues early. One customer said: ‘We have tried a few alternatives… AiSDR is the solution that we chose. They yield results and ensure the tool is used to its capacity.’ You provide direction and ICP; we handle the heavy lifting. So adoption isn’t just on you—we’re in the loop to make sure campaigns launch and deliver.”

**Proof point**:  
- “They yield results and ensure the tool is used to its capacity” (Finley Berry, Satchel Pulse, RevOps lead)  
- GTM engineer, 1–3 days to launch; 24/7 support; monthly/biweekly check-ins (pricing, platform)  
- “You provide strategic direction and ICP. AiSDR handles the operational heavy lifting” (homepage)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What happened with the last tool—did people not adopt it, or did it not deliver? We can show you how we’re different on both.”

### 3. “We need to show ROI per client / per campaign”

**Why they say this**:  
Agency or RevOps must attribute cost and results; need clear ROI story for leadership or clients.

**Acknowledge**:  
“ROI attribution is non-negotiable when you’re running for multiple stakeholders.”

**Respond**:  
“One subscription, one flat cost—so you know exactly what you’re spending. All activity syncs to HubSpot or Salesforce, so you can see which campaigns and clients are driving meetings and pipeline. No spreadsheets to reconcile five vendors. Our agency customer said the flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI. You get reply rates, meetings booked, and pipeline in your CRM. We can walk through how you’d report ROI per client or per campaign with the data you’d have.”

**Proof point**:  
- “The flat cost makes it easy to track expenses and calculate ROI” (Ricardo Mong, Archangel Group)  
- “All activity in your CRM”; “One platform”; HubSpot/Salesforce sync (value props, platform)  
- Case studies with reply rates, meetings, pipeline (Fidus 29.5x ROI, Classter $750K, etc.)

**Follow-up question**:  
“How do you today attribute cost and results across tools? What would one invoice and one CRM view change for your reporting?”
