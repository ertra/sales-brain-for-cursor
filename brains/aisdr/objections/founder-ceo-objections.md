# Founder / CEO – Objection Handling

## Overview

Objections from founders and CEOs evaluating AiSDR. Focus on cost, speed, niche, and “we’re not ready for outbound.” Use [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for “too expensive,” “AI can’t sell in my niche,” “tried other tools,” “spam cannon,” and “no time to manage.” Below: “we can’t afford any tool” and “we need revenue yesterday.”

## Objections

### 1. “We can’t afford any outbound tool right now”

**Why they say this**:  
Budget is tight; R&D or other priorities; $900/mo feels like a lot for a startup.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Budget is real. Every dollar counts.”

**Respond**:  
“What’s the cost of not having pipeline? AiSDR is $900/mo vs. $6k for an SDR or $1,8k for a fragmented stack. We’ve had customers say they can’t afford a top-of-funnel team—and that AiSDR is doing the work of 2–3 people. It pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals; many see positive ROI in 30–60 days. Quarterly billing, cancel anytime—no long-term lock-in. So you’re not betting the company; you’re testing pipeline for a quarter. Want to see the math for your deal size?”

**Proof point**:  
- “We cannot afford a top-of-funnel outbound team… This is doing the work of 2–3 people right now” (Bret Dvoracek)  
- “Pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals”; “29.5x ROI” (Fidus); “CA$394K” deal (Karina Uppal)  
- $900/mo Explore; quarterly; cancel anytime (pricing)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What would 2–3 closed deals in the next quarter do for runway or growth? How does that compare to $900?”

### 2. “We need revenue yesterday—can this actually move the needle fast?”

**Why they say this**:  
Can’t wait months; need first meetings and first deals soon; skeptical that AI can deliver quickly.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Speed matters when you need revenue now.”

**Respond**:  
“We get you live in under a week. Some customers see results within the first 50 messages. We’ve had first meeting in 3 days since launch—and 8 meetings in 30 days, fully hands-off. 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads; first meeting often in 1–2 weeks. You’re not waiting a quarter to see if it works. You can try the AI Strategist now with your website and get 5 free GTM playbooks—no commitment. Then if you sign up, we have you launching in 1–3 days with a GTM engineer.”

**Proof point**:  
- “First meeting in 3 days” (Dry runZ); “8 meetings in 30 days. Fully hands-off”  
- “Some clients see results within the first 50 messages”; “Live in under a week” (homepage, platform)  
- “1–3 meetings per 100 leads”; “First meeting in 1–2 weeks” (pricing, value props)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What’s the fastest you’ve ever got a first meeting from cold outbound? What would 3 days or 2 weeks mean for you?”

### 3. “We’re not ready for outbound yet / our offer isn’t proven”

**Why they say this**:  
Product-market fit concerns; “AI can’t fix a broken offer”; don’t want to burn domain on a bad message.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Outbound works best when the offer is clear.”

**Respond**:  
“We’re not for fixing a broken offer—we’re for when you have something to say and need to say it at scale. The AI Strategist can help you test angles: drop your website, get 5 GTM playbooks in minutes. You can run a small segment and see what resonates before scaling. We only trigger outreach when there’s a verifiable reason to talk, and we research every lead—so we’re not blasting; we’re testing with quality. If you’re not sure on message, we can start with one narrow segment and one angle and learn fast.”

**Proof point**:  
- “Expecting AI to fix a broken offer” is in AiSDR’s “not for” list (homepage)  
- AI Strategist: “5 free tailored GTM campaign ideas”; “Get my GTM plays” (homepage)  
- “Only trigger outreach when there is a verifiable reason to talk” (elephant in the room)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What’s the one segment or use case you’d be willing to test first? We can design a small pilot around that.”
