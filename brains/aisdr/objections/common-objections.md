# Common Objections (AiSDR)

## Overview

Cross-cutting objections from AiSDR’s “Let’s address the elephant in the room” (homepage): cost, niche fit, existing SDRs, past tool failure, spam/deliverability, and time to manage. Use these responses for any persona; see persona-specific files for role-deep objections. G2 reviews were not scraped (403); objections and responses are from aisdr.com.

## Objections

### 1. “This is too expensive”

**Why they say this**:  
$900/mo feels like a big commitment; budget pressure; compare to “free” or low-cost tools.

**Acknowledge**:  
“$900/month is an investment.”

**Respond**:  
“Compared to a $6,000/month SDR or a $1,800/month tool stack—database, enrichment, sequencer, deliverability—AiSDR replaces that stack and does the work. Most customers see positive ROI within 30–60 days. The coolest part? AiSDR pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals. We’re transparent: quarterly plans, cancel anytime. No long-term lock-in. Want to see the math for your team?”

**Proof point**:  
- “29.5x ROI” (Fidus case study); “campaign produced an open deal around CA$394K” (Karina Uppal)  
- “Pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals”; “positive ROI within 30–60 days” (homepage)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What are you spending today on SDRs or on database + sequencer + enrichment? How would $900/mo and one platform change that?”

### 2. “AI can’t sell in my niche”

**Why they say this**:  
Industry is complex or regulated; worry that generic AI will sound wrong or miss nuance.

**Acknowledge**:  
“Generic AI often can’t. Niche matters.”

**Respond**:  
“AiSDR isn’t one-size-fits-all. We’re built to be an industry insider: our AI researches your specific industry nuances so every message reflects the domain expertise your prospects expect. Your outreach will sound like a seasoned rep who knows your niche. We have case studies in pharma, legaltech, healthcare, SaaS, agencies—see who’s already booking meetings in your space.”

**Proof point**:  
- “AiSDR is built to be an industry insider” (homepage)  
- Case studies: Medisafe (pharma), Archangel (legaltech, construction, healthcare), Fidus (enterprise), Classter (EdTech), etc.

**Follow-up question**:  
“What would ‘sounding like you know our space’ look like in the first line of an email? I can show you a sample.”

### 3. “We already have SDRs”

**Why they say this**:  
Don’t want to replace people; SDRs are doing the job; fear of “AI replacing us.”

**Acknowledge**:  
“Perfect. Keep them.”

**Respond**:  
“The average SDR spends 70% of their day on grunt work: prospecting, list cleaning, research, manual follow-ups. AiSDR automates that so your SDRs focus on conversations that drive revenue. We’re not replacing SDRs—we’re giving them leverage. One customer said: ‘This is doing the work of 2–3 people right now.’ Your team keeps the high-value conversations; AiSDR handles the research, sequences, and reply speed so nothing slips.”

**Proof point**:  
- “70% of day on grunt work” (AiSDR positioning); “35%+ more time” for reps (platform)  
- “This is doing the work of 2–3 people right now” (Bret Dvoracek, Software Development)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What would your SDRs do with 35%+ of their time back? Would they run more campaigns or focus on closing conversations?”

---

### 4. “We’ve tried other outreach tools before”

**Why they say this**:  
Burn from volume tools, mail-merge tools, or AI that didn’t convert; skepticism.

**Acknowledge**:  
“And they probably didn’t work the way you hoped.”

**Respond**:  
“Most outbound tools are fancy mail merges—volume over relevance. AiSDR is different: we find prospects based on real buyer signals, research each person, and write messages like a human. The average cold email success rate is under 1%. We get you 1–3 meetings per 100 leads. Reply rates are consistently 3–4x higher than industry average because we don’t blast—we target and research first. Want to see how we’re different from what you tried?”

**Proof point**:  
- “1–3 meetings per 100 leads”; “3–4x higher reply rates than industry average” (homepage, About)  
- “42k messages sent, 3 meetings, 0 pipeline—that’s not outreach, that’s expensive noise” (AiSDR contrast)

**Follow-up question**:  
“What happened with the last tool—deliverability, reply rate, or no pipeline? We can show you exactly where we’re built differently.”

### 5. “It’s just another spam cannon”

**Why they say this**:  
Inbox full of AI slop; fear of burning domain; “everyone’s doing AI outreach.”

**Acknowledge**:  
“Spam is a real problem. We get it.”

**Respond**:  
“Spam is volume without intent. We’re the opposite. AiSDR only triggers outreach when there’s a verifiable reason to talk—intent signals, research, relevance. We combine intent data with high-quality personalization so we maintain your brand reputation and deliver results. That’s why our reply rates are consistently 3–4x higher than the industry average. We’re the AI that refuses to spam.”

**Proof point**:  
- “AI that refuses to spam”; “Only triggers outreach when there is a verifiable reason to talk” (homepage)  
- “Reply rates 3–4x higher than industry average”; “95% deliverability rate” (platform)

**Follow-up question**:  
“Have you had deliverability issues before? We can walk through how we protect your domain—warmup, research per lead, no volume-for-volume’s sake.”

---

### 6. “We don’t have time to manage another tool”

**Why they say this**:  
Tool sprawl; ops overload; “one more login, one more thing to fix.”

**Acknowledge**:  
“A fragmented stack is exhausting to manage.”

**Respond**:  
“AiSDR is built to be low-maintenance. A fragmented stack demands constant babysitting—integrations, list cleaning, troubleshooting. We consolidate that: you provide strategic direction and ICP, AiSDR handles prospecting, research, and follow-ups. You spend time on high-level performance review. Your reps save 35%+ more time. We get you live in 1–3 days with a GTM engineer; 24/7 support and check-ins so the tool is used to its capacity. One platform, not one more patchwork.”

**Proof point**:  
- “We consolidate that workflow”; “You provide strategic direction and ICP. AiSDR handles the operational heavy lifting” (homepage)  
- “35%+ more time” for reps; “1–3 days to launch”; “used to its capacity” (Satchel Pulse, RevOps)

**Follow-up question**:  
“How many tools touch outbound today? What would one platform and 35%+ time back mean for your team?”
