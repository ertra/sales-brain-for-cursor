# Prospecting with AI (AI Prospecting)

## Overview

Prospecting with AI is AiSDR’s intent-first lead discovery and list-building layer. Instead of static lists, it uses live AI search and real-time signals: users describe who they want in plain English (or use criteria and intent signals), and the system builds a fresh list from public web data. It works with the native 300M+/700M+ lead database, Sales Navigator, and HubSpot/Salesforce lists (scoring and updating so outreach targets in-market buyers). Capabilities include website visitor de-anonymization, LinkedIn engagement-based lead generation, and cold outreach triggered by buyer intent.

## Main features

- **Live AI search** — Describe ICP in plain English; get a list built on the spot with current data (not a locked, stale database).
- **Intent and signals** — Buyer intent, hiring intent, funding rounds, tech stack, news/earnings mentions; any public signal can be a trigger.
- **Data sources** — Native database (300M+ or 700M+ leads cited across pages); Sales Navigator for real-time LinkedIn data; HubSpot/Salesforce list sync with scoring and updates.
- **Lead generation methods** — De-anonymize website visitors; generate leads from LinkedIn engagement; add your own leads; send cold outreach with buyer intent.
- **Credits** — Plan tiers (Explore, Grow, Enterprise) include monthly lead search credits; usage scales with plan.

## Problem solved

Stale or narrow databases; lists that don’t reflect “who’s in market now”; manual research to build and refresh lists; disconnect between list tools and the sequencer/outreach tool.

## Value proposition

Target pain and timing, not just profile: lists stay current, criteria are flexible (plain English or structured), and the same system that builds the list runs the outreach, so intent and execution stay aligned.

## Target customers

Same as AiSDR platform: teams that care about lead quality and timing. Especially relevant for teams that have outgrown static lists or want to test new segments and signals without buying another database or enrichment stack.
