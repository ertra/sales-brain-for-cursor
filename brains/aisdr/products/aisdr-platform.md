# AiSDR Platform

## Overview

The AiSDR platform is the core AI sales development product: one AI that acts as inbound SDR, outbound SDR, lead nurturer, and in-house qualifier. It sends deeply researched, personalized outreach in the customer’s voice over email, LinkedIn, and (with Aircall) phone, then qualifies replies and books meetings. Setup is persona-based (ICP, pains, value props, writing style); campaigns use configurable multi-channel sequences with multimedia (e.g. memes, AI-generated videos, voice notes). Integrates natively with Gmail/Outlook, Calendly, HubSpot, and Salesforce; optional turnkey email infrastructure and warmup to protect deliverability.

## Main capabilities (by “hat”)

- **Inbound SDR** — Follows up with every inbound lead in under 10 minutes with a unique answer; automates follow-ups by context; handles replies and questions; email, SMS, LinkedIn. Claimed impact: up to 78% conversion increase, 3–14.5% CTR, 10–20% reply rate, 8x more pipeline.
- **Outbound SDR** — Finds prospects (built-in 700M+ lead database, buyer/hiring intent, funding, tech stack, news), runs cold email and follow-ups with researched messaging and icebreakers (e.g. memes, AI videos). Claimed: 1–3% CR to meetings booked, 1.5–4.89% reply rate, 95% deliverability.
- **Marketer / nurturer** — Personalized nurturing sequences; learns from past interactions; works across funnel stages via HubSpot; re-activates unresponsive/lost leads. Claimed: 68% open rate, 5–10 min response time.
- **In-house qualifier** — Syncs to HubSpot lists; scores leads by buyer/hiring intent; flags who needs nurturing; data-driven insights. Claimed: 100 qualified leads added daily, 100% of pipeline processed, 1–5% lead-to-demo CR.

## Problem solved

Manual, low-volume or low-quality outbound; slow or generic inbound follow-up; scattered tools (database, sequencer, enrichment, copy); deliverability and domain risk; SDR time spent on research and repetitive follow-up instead of closing.

## Value proposition

An AI SDR that “speaks with prospects in your voice,” books qualified meetings that show up, and consolidates outreach from list-building to booked demo in one platform—without burning the domain or optimizing for volume over pipeline.

## Target customers

Revenue teams that need pipeline without adding headcount; founders who need revenue quickly; sales leaders tired of AI activity that doesn’t convert; SDRs who want to get outbound right. Best fit: teams that care about lead quality, timing, and credibility over “emails sent.”

## Pricing (included in company plans)

Quarterly plans (Explore, Grow, Enterprise); all include the platform, persona setup, sequences, HubSpot/Salesforce sync, AI Strategist access, onboarding (GTM engineer, turnkey email), 24/7 support. See [company](../company.md) and pricing page for tiers.
