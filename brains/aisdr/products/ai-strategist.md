# AI Strategist

## Overview

AI Strategist is AiSDR’s GTM strategy layer: it generates data-backed outreach playbooks and campaign ideas through conversation, so teams can go from “who do we target and what do we say?” to a concrete, launchable plan in minutes instead of days. Users provide context (e.g. website URL or ICP); the AI returns ICP, target audience, time-sensitive buyer signals, messaging angle, and a full sequence. Campaigns can be launched with one click from the Strategist into the AiSDR platform.

## Main features

- **Conversation-led setup** — Simple dialogue (e.g. drop website URL) to get tailored GTM ideas; positioned as replacing ~3 days of work by a senior growth consultant with ~20 minutes.
- **Structured output** — ICP, target audience, buyer signals, messaging angle, complete sequence.
- **One-click launch** — Playbooks feed directly into AiSDR campaigns.
- **Included in all plans** — Available on Explore, Grow, and Enterprise; free “Get free AI outreach strategies” / “Get my GTM plays” entry points on site (e.g. 5 free tailored GTM campaign ideas).

## Problem solved

Unclear who to target or what message to use; slow GTM planning; dependency on external consultants or internal senior capacity for strategy before execution.

## Value proposition

GTM strategy and execution in one place: get campaign ideas and sequences in minutes, then run them in the same platform without re-entering strategy into another tool.

## Target customers

Same as AiSDR platform: revenue teams, founders, and sales leaders who want pipeline quickly and prefer not to guess on segments or copy. Especially useful for teams testing new segments or scaling from first playbook to many.
