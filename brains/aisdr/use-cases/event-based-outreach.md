# Use Case: Event-Based Outreach (Webinars, Invite-Only Events)

## Overview

Teams run webinars, invite-only events, or event-triggered campaigns and need timely, personalized outreach to registrants or target attendees. AiSDR runs event-driven sequences (e.g. invite to event, follow-up post-event) with research-backed messaging and fast reply. Outcome: higher attendance and reply rates; best campaign in case study hit 6.19% reply rate for an invite-only event.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS, services, any vertical that uses events for pipeline
- **Size**: Any; marketing and sales work together on events
- **Characteristics**: Use events (webinars, roundtables, invite-only) as part of GTM; want personalized invites and follow-up at scale

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader, Director of Demand Gen, SDR, Marketing (event owner)
- **Secondary**: AE (follow-up on attendees)

### Trigger Event
- Upcoming webinar or invite-only event; need to fill seats and/or follow up with high-value prospects; past events had low reply or show rates

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Generic event invites and reminders; low reply or show rate
- Manual follow-up to key accounts or registrants doesn’t scale
- No consistent, personalized sequence for invite → reminder → post-event
- Event list sits in CRM or spreadsheet without timely outreach

### Desired State (After)
- Personalized event invites and follow-up; research-backed messaging where possible
- Timely sequences (invite, reminder, post-event); replies handled and meetings booked
- Higher reply rates and attendance; best-in-class example: 6.19% reply rate (Fortune 500 case study)
- All event outreach and replies in CRM

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: [AiSDR Platform](../products/aisdr-platform.md) (sequences, email + LinkedIn, personalization, reply handling)
- **Supporting**: HubSpot/Salesforce (event lists, registrants); [AI Strategist](../products/ai-strategist.md) (campaign angle for event)

### Solution Overview
Build or sync event list (registrants, target attendees) in HubSpot/Salesforce or upload to AiSDR. Create persona and campaign goal (event-based outreach). Build sequence: invite, reminder(s), post-event follow-up; personalize with event context and research where available. AiSDR sends messages, handles replies, qualifies interest, and books meetings. Sync all activity to CRM.

### Implementation Steps
1. Define event and audience; build or sync list (registrants or target accounts)
2. Create persona and event-specific messaging (invite, reminder, post-event)
3. Build sequence with timing (e.g. invite 2 weeks out, reminder 3 days out, follow-up 1 day after)
4. Add calendar or registration link; configure reply handling (questions, objections, meeting booking)
5. Launch; monitor reply rates and attendance; iterate on messaging or segments
6. Post-event: use same platform for nurture or meeting booking

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Typical before | With AiSDR (proof) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Reply rate (event invite) | Low single-digit | 4.07% avg event invites; 6.19% best campaign (Fortune 500) |
| Cold reply rate (same client) | 1.63% | 6.19% for invite-only event |
| Consistency | Manual, inconsistent | Automated sequences; replies in 5–10 min |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Personalized event outreach at scale; not just bulk reminders
- One platform for event and ongoing nurture; all in CRM
