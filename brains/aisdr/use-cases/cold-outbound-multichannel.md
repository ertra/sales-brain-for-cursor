# Use Case: Cold Outbound (Email + LinkedIn Multichannel)

## Overview

Teams need to fill pipeline with cold outreach that doesn’t burn domain or sound generic. AiSDR runs multichannel cold campaigns (email, LinkedIn connection requests, DMs, InMail, optional voice notes and video) with research-backed messaging and intent-first targeting. Outcome: 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads, reply rates 3–4x industry average, first meeting in 1–2 weeks.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: SaaS, services, agencies, healthcare, finance, EdTech, legaltech, etc.
- **Size**: 2–10 to 201–500+; startups to enterprise
- **Characteristics**: Need pipeline from outbound; care about lead quality and deliverability; may have tried other tools and been disappointed

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader, Founder/CEO, SDR, RevOps/Agency Lead
- **Secondary**: Marketing (if nurturing is combined), AE (receives booked meetings)

### Trigger Event
- Pipeline gap; new segment or geography; launch of outbound motion; replacement of manual SDR or underperforming tool

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Manual cold email and LinkedIn don’t scale; 20+ min per lead on research
- Volume-focused tools burn domain or deliver 0 pipeline (“42k messages, 3 meetings, 0 pipeline”)
- Multiple tools (database, sequencer, enrichment, copy) don’t sync; unclear ROI
- Reply rates &lt;1% or inconsistent; slow or no follow-up

### Desired State (After)
- Cold outreach that sounds human and is research-backed; 1–3 meetings per 100 leads
- One platform from list build to booked meeting; all activity in CRM
- Reply rates 3–4x industry average; deliverability protected; first meeting in 1–2 weeks

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: [AiSDR Platform](../products/aisdr-platform.md) (outbound SDR “hat,” sequences, email + LinkedIn, qualification, meeting booking)
- **Supporting**: [AI Prospecting](../products/ai-prospecting.md) (live AI search, intent signals, list building); [AI Strategist](../products/ai-strategist.md) (GTM playbook and campaign ideas)

### Solution Overview
Use AI Prospecting (or HubSpot/Salesforce lists) to build a list on intent and signals. Configure persona and campaign goal in AiSDR; add channels (email, LinkedIn connection requests, DMs, InMail, optional voice notes/video). AiSDR researches each lead, sends personalized messages, follows up, handles objections, and books meetings when prospects are ready. All activity syncs to HubSpot or Salesforce.

### Implementation Steps
1. Define ICP and buyer signals (or drop website link; AI Strategist can suggest playbooks in ~20 min)
2. Build list via Live AI search, Sales Navigator, or CRM list; score/update in AiSDR
3. Create persona (ICP, pains, value props, writing style); set campaign goal to cold outbound
4. Build sequence: email + LinkedIn steps, follow-up rules, calendar link; optional Aircall steps
5. Launch; monitor reply rates and meetings; AiSDR qualifies and books demos
6. Review in CRM; iterate on segments or messaging with AI Strategist if needed

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Typical before | With AiSDR (claims) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| Reply rate | &lt;1% cold email | 1.5–4.89% (outbound); 3–4x industry avg |
| Meetings per 100 leads | 0–1 | 1–3 qualified |
| Time to first meeting | Weeks–months | 1–2 weeks (e.g. 3 days in case study) |
| Deliverability | At risk with volume tools | 95% (platform claim); warmup handled |
| CR to meetings booked | Very low | 1–3% (platform claim) |

### Qualitative Benefits
- “AI that refuses to spam”—only outreach when there’s a verifiable reason
- One platform; no juggling database, sequencer, enrichment, copy
- Research before every message; “credibility at scale”

## Proof Points

- Fidus: 9.71% positive response rate, 29.5x ROI, 18 meetings (Siemens, Emerson, Boeing, Microsoft)
- Xcela: 7 meetings from 400 cold leads, 5.25% positive response rate, 33% reply-to-demo
- Dry runZ: 8 meetings in 30 days, first meeting 3 days after launch
- Archangel: 25K+ emails across 7 clients, up to 12.7% cold reply rate
- Fortune 500 (Hakkoda): 6.19% reply rate (best campaign), 8,000+ emails in 4.5 months

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How are you running cold outbound today—in-house SDRs, tools, or both? What reply rates and meetings are you seeing?
2. How much time do you spend per lead on research and writing? What would one platform from list to booked meeting mean for you?
3. Have you had deliverability or “sounding like a bot” issues with other tools?
4. What would 1–3 qualified meetings per 100 leads and first meeting in 1–2 weeks do for your pipeline?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Live AI search / intent-based list building; HubSpot or Salesforce list sync and scoring
- Persona and sequence builder (email + LinkedIn, follow-up rules)
- Sample AI-researched message; reply and objection handling; meeting booking flow
- CRM sync and reporting

### Key Talking Points
- “Pipeline over activity—we optimize for meetings that show up”
- “1–3 meetings per 100 leads; reply rates 3–4x industry average”
- “Research before every message—no scraping bios”
- “One platform from list build to booked meeting; all in your CRM”
