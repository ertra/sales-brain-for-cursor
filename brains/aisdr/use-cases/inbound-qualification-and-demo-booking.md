# Use Case: Inbound Lead Follow-Up and Demo Booking

## Overview

Teams lose pipeline when inbound leads wait hours or days for a reply or get generic auto-responders. AiSDR acts as inbound SDR: every lead gets a unique, personalized answer in under 10 minutes; the AI asks qualifying questions, responds to demo requests, handles objections, and books meetings. Email, SMS, LinkedIn. Outcome: up to 78% conversion increase (platform claim), 10–20% reply rate, 8x more pipeline; “first to respond” advantage.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS, services, any vertical with inbound (forms, chat, events)
- **Size**: Any; especially teams with meaningful inbound volume but limited SDR capacity
- **Characteristics**: Use HubSpot or Salesforce; want fast, personalized response; care about conversion from request to demo

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader, SDR, RevOps
- **Secondary**: Marketing (inbound source), AE (receives qualified demos)

### Trigger Event
- Inbound volume growing; slow or inconsistent response; lost “first to respond” wins; need to qualify before demos

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Inbound leads wait hours or days for a reply; generic auto-responders don’t convert
- Manual follow-up doesn’t scale; SDRs can’t reply in &lt;10 min to every lead
- No consistent qualification (appetite, budget) before booking demo; dead-end meetings
- Follow-up sequences are manual or rigid; replies slip

### Desired State (After)
- Every inbound lead gets a unique answer in under 10 minutes
- AI asks qualifying questions, responds to demo requests, handles objections, books when ready
- Higher conversion from request to demo; 8x more pipeline (platform claim); AEs get qualified meetings

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: [AiSDR Platform](../products/aisdr-platform.md) (inbound SDR “hat”: follow-up, qualification, demo booking, replies in 5–10 min)
- **Supporting**: HubSpot/Salesforce integration (inbound lists, activity sync)

### Solution Overview
Connect AiSDR to HubSpot or Salesforce so new inbound leads flow into campaigns. Configure persona and goal (inbound nurture / demo booking). AiSDR sends every lead a unique, personalized reply in under 10 minutes; asks qualifying questions; responds to demo requests and handles common objections; books meeting when prospect is ready. Email, SMS, LinkedIn; all activity in CRM.

### Implementation Steps
1. Integrate HubSpot or Salesforce; map inbound sources (forms, chat, events) to lists or triggers
2. Create persona (ICP, value props, tone); set campaign goal to inbound / demo booking
3. Configure reply rules: qualify first, respond to demo requests, handle objections, add calendar link
4. Set response time target (e.g. 5–10 min); enable co-pilot or full auto as needed
5. Launch; monitor reply rates and demo bookings; route complex questions to humans
6. Review conversion from request → qualified demo in CRM

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Typical before | With AiSDR (claims) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| Response time | Hours–days | 5–10 minutes |
| Conversion (inbound → demo) | Variable | Up to 78% increase (platform) |
| Reply rate | Low on generic auto-reply | 10–20% (platform) |
| Pipeline from inbound | Baseline | 8x more (platform claim) |
| CTR | Low | 3–14.5% (platform) |

### Qualitative Benefits
- “First to respond” advantage; every lead gets a unique answer
- Qualification before demo—fewer dead-end meetings for AEs
- Consistent follow-up; nothing slips

## Proof Points

- “It booked a call for me on the first day of using the platform!” (Nelly W., GMDH)

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How fast do you respond to inbound leads today? What’s the average time from request to first reply?
2. Do you qualify before booking demos? How many demos are no-shows or bad-fit?
3. What would it mean if every lead got a unique, personalized reply in under 10 minutes?
4. How much SDR time goes to inbound follow-up vs. outbound? Would you reallocate if inbound was automated?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Inbound campaign setup; HubSpot/Salesforce trigger or list
- Sample “unique answer” and qualification flow; demo request and objection handling
- 5–10 min reply time; calendar booking; CRM sync
- Co-pilot vs. full auto; routing complex questions to team

### Key Talking Points
- “Every inbound lead gets a unique answer in under 10 minutes”
- “Be the business that responds first—up to 78% conversion increase”
- “Qualify before you book—fewer dead-end demos”
- “8x more pipeline from inbound; all activity in your CRM”
