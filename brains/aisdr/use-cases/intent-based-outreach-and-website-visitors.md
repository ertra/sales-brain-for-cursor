# Use Case: Intent-Based Outreach and Website Visitor Conversion

## Overview

Teams want to reach prospects when they’re in-market—not just when they fit a static profile. AiSDR uses live AI search and real-time signals (buyer intent, hiring intent, funding, tech stack, news, LinkedIn engagement) to build lists and trigger outreach. Website visitor de-anonymization turns anonymous visitors into leads; outreach is personalized from intent and behavior. Outcome: “Target pain, not just profiles”; 1–3 meetings per 100 leads; reply rates 3–4x industry average.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS, services, any vertical where intent signals matter (e.g. hiring, funding, tech adoption)
- **Size**: Any; especially teams that have outgrown static lists or want to test new segments
- **Characteristics**: Use or consider intent data, website tracking, LinkedIn; want lists that stay current and outreach that proves “we did our homework”

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader, SDR, RevOps, Founder/CEO
- **Secondary**: Marketing (website, content); AE (receives meetings from high-intent leads)

### Trigger Event
- Static lists going stale; want to “target pain, not just profiles”; new segment or signal (e.g. hiring, funding); need to convert website visitors without manual research

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Lists from static database or old exports; no real-time signal that prospect is in-market
- Website visitors anonymous; manual research to identify and reach them
- “Personalization” = merge fields from stale data; no link to current intent or behavior
- Outreach timing is guesswork; reply rates suffer

### Desired State (After)
- Lists built or updated on intent signals (buyer, hiring, funding, tech stack, news, LinkedIn)
- Website visitors de-anonymized; contact and company data; outreach triggered by pages visited or intent
- Every message backed by research and relevance; “credibility at scale”
- Same platform builds list and runs outreach—intent and execution aligned

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: [AI Prospecting](../products/ai-prospecting.md) (live AI search, intent signals, website visitor de-anonymization, LinkedIn engagement); [AiSDR Platform](../products/aisdr-platform.md) (research, sequences, outreach, booking)
- **Supporting**: HubSpot/Salesforce (list sync, scoring); [AI Strategist](../products/ai-strategist.md) (GTM playbook, signals to target)

### Solution Overview
Use Live AI search to describe ICP and signals in plain English (or use structured criteria); AiSDR builds a fresh list from public web data. Add website visitor tracking (Enterprise or plan feature) to de-anonymize visitors and enrich with contact/company data. Optionally use LinkedIn engagement (e.g. post engagement, profile visits) as trigger. Configure persona and sequence in AiSDR; research each lead before sending; run multichannel outreach. Lists stay current; messaging reflects intent and behavior.

### Implementation Steps
1. Define ICP and intent signals (buyer, hiring, funding, tech stack, keywords, etc.); AI Strategist can suggest in ~20 min
2. Build list via Live AI search or sync HubSpot/Salesforce list; enable scoring and updates
3. If available: enable website visitor de-anonymization and enrichment; map to campaigns
4. Create persona and sequence; ensure “research before every message” is on
5. Launch; monitor reply rates and meetings; refresh lists or signals as needed
6. Use CRM to attribute pipeline to intent-based vs. static segments

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How do you build and refresh outbound lists today? How often do they go stale?
2. Do you use intent data, website tracking, or LinkedIn signals? What would “target pain, not just profiles” mean for you?
3. How do you today convert website visitors into leads? What would de-anonymization and automated outreach do?
4. Is your list tool separate from your sequencer? What breaks when intent and execution are in different systems?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Live AI search: describe ICP and signals in plain English; show list built on current data
- Intent signals: buyer, hiring, funding, tech stack, news; filters (e.g. seniority)
- Website visitor de-anonymization (if plan includes); enrichment and campaign trigger
- Research before message: sample lead and how AI uses intent + behavior for copy
- CRM sync: list and activity in HubSpot/Salesforce

### Key Talking Points
- “Target pain, not just profiles—we find people in real time with problems you can solve”
- “Live AI search: describe who you want in plain English; get a fresh list, data current as of today”
- “Website visitors: de-anonymize, enrich, and reach them with context on what they viewed”
