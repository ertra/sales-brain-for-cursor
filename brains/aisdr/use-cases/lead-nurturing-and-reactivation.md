# Use Case: Lead Nurturing and Reactivation

## Overview

Teams have leads in the funnel that went cold or unresponsive and need to re-activate them without manual, one-off emails. AiSDR runs nurturing sequences that learn from past interactions, personalize with HubSpot properties and pain points, and re-activate lost or unresponsive leads. Works across funnel stages via HubSpot integration. Outcome: 68% open rate (platform claim), 5–10 min response time, 96.6x faster outreach; reactivation campaign in case study hit 11.8% positive response rate.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS, services, any vertical with a considered purchase and nurturing motion
- **Size**: Any; especially teams with HubSpot and existing lead database
- **Characteristics**: Have leads that went cold; want to nurture by stage and behavior; need consistency and speed without SDR doing every send manually

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader, SDR, RevOps, Marketing (if owns nurture)
- **Secondary**: AE (receives re-engaged leads); Marketing (content, funnel stages)

### Trigger Event
- Large pool of cold or unresponsive leads; need to re-activate without burning domain; want nurture that’s personalized and timely; current nurture is manual or low-performing

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Cold or unresponsive leads sit in CRM; no systematic re-activation
- Nurture is manual (SDR sends one-off emails) or generic (same sequence for everyone)
- No learning from past interactions; no alignment to funnel stage or HubSpot properties
- Slow response when a lead re-engages; “first to respond” lost

### Desired State (After)
- Automated nurturing that’s personalized by stage, behavior, and CRM data
- Re-activation campaigns that don’t feel like spam; research and relevance where possible
- Fast reply (5–10 min) when leads respond; qualification and meeting booking
- All nurture and reactivation in one platform; synced to HubSpot/Salesforce

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: [AiSDR Platform](../products/aisdr-platform.md) (marketer/nurturer “hat”; sequences, HubSpot integration, personalization, reply in 5–10 min)
- **Supporting**: HubSpot (lists, properties, funnel stages); [AI Strategist](../products/ai-strategist.md) (nurture angle or segment ideas)

### Solution Overview
Sync HubSpot lists (e.g. cold leads, specific stage, unresponsive) to AiSDR. Create persona and campaign goal (nurture / reactivation). Build sequence that addresses pain points and uses HubSpot properties for personalization; tailor content by stage. AiSDR sends messages, learns from interactions, responds in 5–10 min when leads reply, qualifies, and books meetings. Re-activate without manual one-off emails; keep deliverability and relevance high.

### Implementation Steps
1. Identify segments: cold leads, unresponsive after X touches, specific funnel stage
2. Sync lists from HubSpot (or Salesforce); map properties for personalization
3. Create persona and nurture/reactivation messaging; align to stage and pain points
4. Build sequence: multi-touch, spaced appropriately; add calendar link and reply handling
5. Launch; monitor open rates, reply rates, and meeting bookings from re-engaged leads
6. Use CRM to track pipeline from reactivation; iterate on segments or messaging

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How many leads in your database are cold or unresponsive? What do you do with them today?
2. Do you run nurture sequences? How personalized are they—by stage, behavior, or HubSpot properties?
3. When a cold lead replies, how fast do you respond? What would 5–10 minute reply do for conversion?
4. Would you run more reactivation if it didn’t require manual one-off emails and didn’t risk deliverability?
