# Target Companies

## Overview

AiSDR’s target companies are B2B revenue teams that need pipeline and qualified meetings without adding (or while optimizing) SDR headcount. The ICP spans startups, SMBs, and enterprises across many industries; positioning is “lead quality over volume” and “meetings that show up.” Case studies and site copy emphasize SaaS, healthcare/pharma, e‑commerce, finance, agencies, EdTech, legal/legaltech, and professional services. Company sizes range from 2–10 to 201–500+; use cases include cold outbound, multichannel outreach, inbound nurturing, event-based and intent-based campaigns.

## Company Profiles

### Revenue teams that need pipeline without adding headcount
- **Profile**: Sales or GTM leaders with pipeline targets; limited or no dedicated SDR team; need predictable meeting flow.
- **Characteristics**: Willing to invest in AI outreach; care about reply rates and qualified meetings, not just “emails sent”; often already use or have tried CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce).
- **Why they buy**: Replace or augment SDR capacity; get “work of 2–3 people” (customer quote); 1–3 demos per 100 leads; first meeting in days to ~2 weeks.

### Founders who need revenue quickly
- **Profile**: Early-stage or scaling startups; can’t wait 6+ months for inbound; need outbound that doesn’t require hiring and training SDRs.
- **Characteristics**: Budget-conscious; want fast time-to-value; open to quarterly commitment if ROI is clear (e.g. “pays for itself with 2–3 closed deals”).
- **Why they buy**: Launch cold or intent-based campaigns in days; no need for a full outbound team; flat cost and clear ROI narrative.

### Sales leaders tired of AI activity that doesn’t convert
- **Profile**: Have tried other outreach or AI tools; frustrated by volume-focused tools that burn domain or deliver no pipeline.
- **Characteristics**: Value deliverability and brand safety; want “3–4x higher reply rates than industry average”; prefer pipeline metrics over activity metrics.
- **Why they buy**: Intent-first targeting, research before every message, qualification and meeting booking; positioning as “AI that refuses to spam.”

### SDRs and ops who want to get outbound right
- **Profile**: SDRs, RevOps, or growth leads who run or support outbound; want one platform instead of database + sequencer + enrichment + copy tools.
- **Characteristics**: Need speed (e.g. launch in 30–60 min); want personalization and follow-up rules without manual research per lead.
- **Why they buy**: End-to-end from list build to booked meeting; 323+ data sources; 50+ frameworks; replies in 5–10 min; HubSpot/Salesforce sync.

### Agencies and consultancies running outreach for multiple clients
- **Profile**: Agencies (e.g. Archangel Group) running cold outreach for several clients; need consistency and flat cost per client.
- **Characteristics**: Multi-industry (legaltech, construction, healthcare, etc.); send 25K+ emails across clients without proportionally growing headcount.
- **Why they buy**: One platform for many clients; predictable cost and ROI; “consistency AiSDR brings” (case study).
