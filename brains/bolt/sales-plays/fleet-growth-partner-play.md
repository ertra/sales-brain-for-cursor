## The Play

### Objective
Add Bolt as a demand channel to improve fleet utilization and revenue while keeping operational complexity low via one partner dashboard.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Join Bolt with your fleet and earn more. Tap into 200M+ riders and manage assets in one easy-to-use dashboard."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Fleet Baseline
**Time**: 20 minutes
- [ ] Capture current utilization, active vehicles, and major demand windows
- [ ] Understand current platform/channel split
- [ ] Define minimum acceptable uplift for pilot

### Step 2: Intro Outreach
**Message Focus**:
- Demand access (200M+ riders)
- One dashboard for operations
- Non-exclusive, additive channel strategy

### Step 3: Discovery
1. What is your current utilization by daypart?
2. Where do you have the most idle capacity?
3. What earnings threshold would make a new channel worth it?
4. Do you prefer phased onboarding by vehicle group?

### Step 4: Pilot Onboarding
- Start with subset of vehicles
- Track utilization and earnings deltas vs baseline
- Review weekly performance and optimize routing/availability

### Step 5: Scale Decision
- Expand to full fleet if thresholds are met
- Keep multi-platform strategy where it maximizes utilization
