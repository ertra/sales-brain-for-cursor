## The Play

### Objective
Replace fragmented travel workflows with Bolt Business as one platform and one invoice for EU-heavy business travel, while improving spend control and reducing admin burden.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Bolt Business gives you one platform for rides, Bolt Drive, scooters/e-bikes, and food for business in the same account. You get custom limits and real-time visibility, plus one consolidated invoice and automated reporting. Start with no activation cost or minimum commitment."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Account Mapping
**Time**: 20-30 minutes
- [ ] Identify travel decision-maker + finance approver
- [ ] Map regions where Bolt coverage is strongest
- [ ] Document current vendor mix and renewal timing
- [ ] Note if car-sharing or micromobility use is currently unmanaged

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Mid-week

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: One invoice for rides + car-sharing + micromobility (EU teams)

Hi {First Name},

If your team is managing business travel across multiple tools, Bolt Business can
consolidate rides, Bolt Drive, and scooters/e-bikes into one platform with one invoice.

You get custom limits, real-time visibility, and automated reporting.
No activation cost and no minimum commitment - easy to pilot by team or country.

Open to a 15-minute fit check for your EU travel program?
```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Key Questions**:
1. How many tools/vendors are involved in your business travel today?
2. Where is most admin time spent (reporting, reconciliation, policy enforcement)?
3. Do you need car-sharing and micromobility under the same policy framework?
4. Which countries/teams would be best for a pilot?

### Step 4: Demo + Pilot Design
- Show policy controls (limits, groups, rules)
- Show one-invoice flow and reporting model
- Configure pilot scope (one team, one country, or one travel use case)
- Define success metrics: admin time saved, policy compliance, spend visibility

### Step 5: Proposal and Expansion
- Propose phased rollout by geography/team
- Keep low-risk entry point (no minimum commitment)
- Tie expansion to measured pilot outcomes

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We're already with Uber for Business" | "Use Bolt where you need rides + Drive + micromobility in one policy and invoice, especially in Europe. Pilot one team/country with no minimum commitment." |
| "We're too small for this" | "Bolt Business works for any size and starts without activation costs or minimums." |
| "Switching sounds hard" | "Run phased rollout and keep current provider during pilot; evaluate outcomes before expansion." |
