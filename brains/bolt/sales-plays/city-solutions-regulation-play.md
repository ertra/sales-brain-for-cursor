## The Play

### Objective
Position Bolt as a city partner (not only an operator): share real-time data and practical regulation insights, demonstrate safety controls and dock impact, and secure pilot or tender advantage.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Bolt City Solutions helps cities regulate and improve shared mobility with real-time data, best practices from 200+ cities, and safety-first operations. Charging docks and safety tooling reduce clutter and operational burden while supporting sustainable transport goals."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping
**Time**: 30 minutes
- [ ] Identify mobility lead, policy owner, procurement lead
- [ ] Review current permit framework and pain points
- [ ] Map current operator set and known public concerns

### Step 2: Pre-Tender Advisory Conversation
- Offer non-commercial workshop on regulation options:
  - Utilization targets
  - Data-sharing requirements
  - Parking/compliance enforcement patterns
  - Dock strategy

### Step 3: Discovery
**Questions**:
1. Which compliance metrics are hardest to monitor today?
2. What public complaints are most frequent (parking, safety, clutter)?
3. What data cadence and format does your team need from operators?
4. How are sustainability goals linked to mobility policy outcomes?

### Step 4: Proposal / Pilot
- Present safety controls (tandem prevention, reaction testing, beginner mode, parking guidance)
- Present dock operating model and expected operational impact
- Define data-sharing package and reporting cadence
- Offer pilot scope or structured tender response support

### Step 5: Governance and Expansion
- Set regular city-operator review cadence
- Track KPI set agreed with city (safety, compliance, utilization)
- Expand fleet/zones based on KPI performance
