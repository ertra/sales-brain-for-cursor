# Case Study: Tallinn (Charging Docks & Operations Impact)

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | City of Tallinn context (Bolt operations example) |
| **Industry** | Public sector / urban mobility |
| **Products Used** | City Solutions, Micromobility (scooters/e-bikes), Charging docks |
| **Primary Persona** | City Mobility / Transport Lead |
| **Use Case** | Reduce street clutter and operational footprint while supporting safe micromobility |

## Executive Summary
Bolt positions Tallinn as a concrete example of City Solutions in action: charging docks reduced battery-swap operations by 50-60 per week, while improving parking behavior and reducing operational traffic linked to battery logistics. The city-level message is operational sustainability plus better public-space outcomes, not just rider growth.

## The Customer
- **Type**: European city mobility context
- **Stakeholders**: City transport/mobility teams, operators, residents
- **Goal**: Safer, cleaner, less cluttered micromobility operations with practical sustainability gains

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- Micromobility operations can require frequent battery swaps and rebalancing
- Frequent operations traffic can add congestion and clutter
- Cities need better parking discipline and visible operator accountability

### Key Pain Points
- Street clutter and pavement concerns
- Operational vehicle traffic from battery swaps
- Need for measurable improvements that support policy decisions

## The Solution

### Why This Approach Worked
- Bolt deployed charging docks as part of city operations
- Dock-based charging reduced need for frequent battery swap routes
- Docks also encouraged better parking behavior and cleaner cityscape

### Products / Capabilities Involved
| Capability | Role |
|------------|------|
| Charging docks | Charge up to 10 units and reduce swap operations |
| City Solutions | Partnership framing with city stakeholders |
| Safety + parking toolkit | Supports better parking behavior and compliance |

## The Results

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Battery-swap operations | 50-60 fewer operations per week (Tallinn example) |
| Operational footprint | Reduced logistics traffic for battery maintenance |
| Parking behavior | Improved via dock-based operations and city design |

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Clear operational story city teams can evaluate
- Better alignment with sustainability and public-space goals
- Stronger argument for structured micromobility infrastructure

## Sales Use

### Best For
- City mobility officers evaluating operator requirements
- Procurement or policy discussions on parking and operational burden
- Stakeholders comparing operators beyond trip volume

### Key Talking Points
1. "Charging docks can materially reduce battery operations traffic."
2. "City Solutions is not only rides; it includes operational design choices that improve public space."
3. "Use dock impact as a practical, measurable metric in city pilots and tenders."

### Objections This Addresses
- "Operators create clutter and more city traffic."
- "Micromobility benefits are hard to measure operationally."
- "We need concrete examples before expanding permits."
