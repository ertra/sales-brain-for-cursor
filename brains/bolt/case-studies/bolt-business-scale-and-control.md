## Executive Summary
Bolt Business presents a broad proof story rather than a single named customer case: 50,000+ businesses use the platform to manage business travel with one dashboard, central billing, and policy controls. The key value pattern is consistent: less manual expense work, better spend control, and easier rollout (no activation costs or minimum commitment).
