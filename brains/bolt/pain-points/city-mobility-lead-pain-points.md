# City Mobility / Transport Lead – Pain Points

## Overview
City mobility and transport leads (municipalities, transport authorities) struggle with regulating micromobility and shared transport: drafting and enforcing rules, getting usable data from operators, managing safety and parking, and reducing congestion and emissions. They want a partner that shares data and best practices and operates safely at scale.

## Pain Points

### 1. Drafting and enforcing micromobility regulation
- **Description**: Cities need to set rules for e-scooters, e-bikes, and car-sharing (parking, fleet size, fees, authorisations) but lack operator perspective and benchmarks. Enforcement is difficult; rules may be vague or inconsistent.
- **Impact**: Poor compliance; citizen and political backlash; operators gaming the system or exiting; repeated policy cycles.
- **Current Solutions**: Copy other cities’ frameworks, trial-and-error, or strict caps that may reduce service quality or innovation.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (policy cycles, permit renewals)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: City Solutions — Bolt shares insights from operating in 200+ cities; input on street rental fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data sharing; "We're here to help" for regulation design.
- **Key Message**: "As the largest micromobility operator in Europe, we're happy to share our insights to help you draft effective micromobility regulation for your city."

### 2. Lack of usable data from operators
- **Description**: Cities need data to monitor compliance, utilisation, and impact (trips, parking, safety). Operators often provide minimal or inconsistent data; hard to compare or enforce.
- **Impact**: Can’t make data-driven decisions; can’t prove impact or hold operators accountable; political and public pressure without evidence.
- **Current Solutions**: Ad-hoc data requests, limited APIs, or mandates that operators resist or fulfil poorly.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (reporting, audits, policy reviews)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: City Solutions — willingness to share data so municipality can monitor regulatory compliance; real-time data and best practices; integration with MaaS applications.
- **Key Message**: "We share real-time data and best practices so you can monitor compliance and improve the lives of your citizens."

### 3. Safety, parking, and public space
- **Description**: Pavement parking, tandem riding, and safety incidents cause citizen and political concern. Cities want fewer badly parked vehicles, safer riding behaviour, and more space for pedestrians.
- **Impact**: Complaints; negative press; pressure to ban or heavily restrict; equity and accessibility concerns.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: City Solutions — safety as priority: tandem prevention, cognitive reaction test (ride sober), Beginner Mode, parking guidance, AI pavement detection; charging docks to reduce street clutter and van collections (e.g. 50–60 fewer battery swaps/week in Tallinn); accessibility (e.g. ambient noise for pedestrians).
- **Key Message**: "Safety as a priority: unique safety features, rider education, responsible parking — and charging docks that reduce clutter and operational footprint."

### 4. Reducing car dependency and emissions
- **Description**: Cities want to cut congestion and emissions while keeping transport convenient. Need credible alternatives (scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, multimodal) that integrate with public transport.
- **Impact**: Climate and air-quality targets missed; car-centric planning persists; modal shift is slow.
- **Frequency**: Strategic / multi-year
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: City Solutions — e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, multimodal, walking; CarbonNeutral® for scooters/e-bikes; charging docks cut CO2 from operations; case for replacing short car trips with zero-emission options.
- **Key Message**: "Rethinking urban transport: tools to reshape city transport — e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, multimodal — and sustainability built in."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Regulation design and enforcement | High | Ongoing | City Solutions (insights, fees, authorisations, utilisation) | 200+ cities; largest European micromobility operator |
| Lack of usable operator data | High | Ongoing | City Solutions (data sharing, real-time, compliance) | Real-time data; MaaS integration; "we're here to help" |
| Safety, parking, public space | High | Ongoing | City Solutions (safety toolkit, docks, AI parking) | Tandem prevention, reaction test, docks reduce clutter |
| Reduce car dependency / emissions | Medium–High | Strategic | City Solutions (multimodal, CarbonNeutral®, docks) | Sustainability narrative; 12% short car trips replaced (scooters) |

## Discovery Questions
1. How are you currently designing or updating micromobility regulation — and do you have enough input from operators who operate at scale?
2. What data do you get from mobility operators today, and is it enough to monitor compliance and utilisation?
3. What are the biggest citizen or political concerns (parking, safety, clutter) and how are you addressing them?
4. How does shared mobility fit into your transport and climate goals — and what would "good" look like in 2–3 years?

## Trigger Events
- New micromobility tender or permit round
- Incident or public backlash (parking, safety) driving policy change
- New climate or transport strategy requiring modal shift and data
- New city mobility or transport lead; desire to align with European best practices
- Expansion of shared mobility (new operators or vehicle types)
