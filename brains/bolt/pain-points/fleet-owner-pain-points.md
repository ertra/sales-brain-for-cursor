# Fleet Owner – Pain Points

## Overview
Fleet owners (transport businesses that own vehicles) struggle with underused assets, fragmented demand, and operational complexity. They want more demand and a simple way to manage their fleet and grow revenue. Bolt addresses this as a partner segment rather than a classic B2B sales motion.

## Pain Points

### 1. Underused fleet and need for demand
- **Description**: Vehicles sit idle; need more trips and predictable utilisation to cover fixed costs and grow revenue. Building own app or demand is expensive and slow.
- **Impact**: Low revenue per vehicle; hard to scale or justify fleet expansion; margin pressure.
- **Current Solutions**: Multiple platforms, street hailing, or direct B2B contracts — often with fragmented reporting and payouts.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Bolt partnership — access to Bolt’s 200+ million riders; one dashboard to manage fleet; "grow your transport business."
- **Key Message**: "Join Bolt with your fleet and earn more. Our riders send you plenty of ride requests; manage your assets from one easy-to-use dashboard."

### 2. Managing fleet across platforms
- **Description**: Using several apps or channels to fill capacity; no single view of vehicles, utilisation, or earnings. Operational and admin overhead.
- **Impact**: Time spent switching between systems; missed optimisation; harder to scale.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: Bolt — one dashboard to manage assets; one partner for rider demand.
- **Key Message**: "Manage your assets from one easy-to-use dashboard and grow your transport business."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Underused fleet / need demand | High | Ongoing | Bolt partnership (rider base, dashboard) | 200M+ riders; 50+ countries; one platform |
| Managing fleet across platforms | Medium | Daily | Bolt (one dashboard) | Single dashboard; one partner |

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you today fill capacity — and what share of your revenue comes from each channel?
2. How do you manage vehicles and see utilisation and earnings — one system or several?
3. What would it take for you to grow the fleet or revenue without proportionally increasing fixed cost?

## Trigger Events
- Fleet expansion or replacement cycle
- Dissatisfaction with current platform(s) (payouts, support, demand)
- New fleet owner or manager looking to maximise utilisation and simplify ops
