# Business Travel Decision-Maker – Pain Points

## Overview
Business travel decision-makers (Travel/Office/Finance/HR) struggle with scattered bookings, manual expense handling, no single view of spend, and pressure to cut costs without hurting employee experience. They want one platform to control, monitor, and simplify work travel and invoicing.

## Pain Points

### 1. Manual expense handling and scattered bookings
- **Description**: Team members book rides (or use personal cards) across multiple apps or providers; expenses land in different systems. Travel manager or finance spends hours reconciling receipts, reports, and policy compliance.
- **Impact**: Wasted admin time; delayed or inaccurate reporting; hard to enforce spending limits or see who travelled where; audit and policy gaps.
- **Current Solutions**: Spreadsheets, manual expense reports, multiple vendor contracts, or accepting the chaos.
- **Frequency**: Daily / weekly (expense cycles)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Bolt Business — centralised account, single invoice for all team rides (and optionally Bolt Drive, scooters, Bolt Food for Business); automated ride reports and third-party integrations to cut manual reconciliation.
- **Key Message**: "Save time: automated ride reports and integrations make manual expenses a thing of the past. One invoice for all work travel."

### 2. No visibility or control over travel spend
- **Description**: No single view of who is travelling, how much is spent, or whether bookings comply with policy. Hard to set or enforce limits; surprises at month-end or budget review.
- **Impact**: Overspend; inability to optimise or negotiate; lack of trust and control; reactive rather than proactive management.
- **Current Solutions**: Ad-hoc checks, post-hoc reports, or rigid policies that hurt employee convenience.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / monthly (reporting and budget cycles)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Bolt Business — set custom spending limits and rules; real-time updates when team travels; organise employees into groups with specific limits; full control and visibility.
- **Key Message**: "Gain full control and visibility: set spending limits and rules, get real-time updates when your team travels."

### 3. Pressure to cut travel costs without hurting experience
- **Description**: Need to reduce travel spend (or justify it) while keeping work travel reliable and convenient for employees (client meetings, commutes, airport trips).
- **Impact**: Trade-off between cost and convenience; risk of employee friction or shadow spending if policy is too tight; budget scrutiny from finance or leadership.
- **Current Solutions**: Switching providers, negotiating rates, or cutting perks — often with limited data on where savings are possible.
- **Frequency**: Quarterly / annual (budget and renewal)
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Bolt Business — competitive pricing per journey; identify cost-saving opportunities without compromising quality; "save your budget for more important things."
- **Key Message**: "Cut travel costs with competitive pricing for every ride — find savings without compromising on quality."

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you today track and reconcile work travel spend — and how much time does that take each month?
2. Do you have spending limits or approval rules for rides/travel? How do you enforce them?
3. Where do you see the biggest opportunity to cut travel cost without making it harder for the team to get to clients or the office?
4. Would a single invoice and automated reports for all work rides (and optionally car rental, scooters, food) change how you manage travel?

## Trigger Events
- New travel or expense policy; finance pushing for visibility or savings
- Contract renewal with current ride/travel provider
- Company growth (more employees travelling); need to scale without scaling admin
- New Travel/Office/Finance lead who wants to consolidate and control spend
- Audit or compliance requirement for expense documentation
