# Use Case: Sustainable Micromobility for Cities

## Overview
Cities want to regulate and grow shared micromobility (e-scooters, e-bikes) in a way that improves safety, reduces clutter and emissions, and supports transport and climate goals. Bolt City Solutions partners with municipalities to share knowledge, real-time data, and best practices—and to operate with safety features (tandem prevention, reaction test, parking guidance, charging docks) and sustainability (CarbonNeutral®, reduced CO2) so cities can "rethink urban transport."

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Public sector — municipalities, city transport departments, regional authorities
- **Size**: Any city or region that has or is considering shared micromobility
- **Characteristics**: Need sustainable transport solutions; care about regulation, data, safety, parking, emissions; may have or plan street rental fees, authorisations, data requirements

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: City mobility / transport lead (City Mobility Officer, Transport Planner, Head of Urban Mobility, Procurement or Policy lead)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Planning, legal, procurement, citizens, operators

### Trigger Event
- New micromobility tender or permit round; incident or public backlash (parking, safety); new climate or transport strategy; new city mobility lead; expansion of shared mobility (new operators or vehicle types).

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Drafting and enforcing micromobility rules is difficult; lack of operator perspective and benchmarks
- Little usable data from operators; hard to monitor compliance and utilisation
- Citizen and political pressure on safety and pavement parking; negative press or calls to restrict
- Climate and congestion targets require modal shift; need credible alternatives and data to prove impact

### Desired State (After)
- Effective regulation (fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data sharing) informed by operator experience
- Real-time data and best practices to monitor compliance and plan transport strategy
- Safer streets: fewer incidents, better parking, less clutter (e.g. charging docks reduce van operations)
- Progress on sustainability: reduced car trips, lower emissions, integration with public transport and MaaS

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: City Solutions (knowledge sharing, data, best practices, safety, sustainability)
- **Supporting**: Micromobility (e-scooters, e-bikes), charging docks, Bolt app and MaaS integration

### Solution Overview
Bolt engages as a partner: share insights from operating in 200+ cities so cities can draft and refine regulation (street rental fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data requirements). Share real-time data so municipalities can monitor compliance and plan. Operate with safety built in (tandem prevention, cognitive reaction test, Beginner Mode, parking guidance, AI pavement detection, charging docks) and sustainability (CarbonNeutral®, reduced CO2, dock-based operations). Integrate with MaaS where relevant. Position: "We're here to help."

### Implementation Steps
1. City contacts Bolt City Solutions; discuss goals (regulation, data, safety, sustainability) and current framework
2. Bolt shares insights on regulation design (fees, authorisations, utilisation, data sharing) and best practices from 200+ cities
3. Agree data sharing and compliance reporting so city can monitor and enforce
4. Bolt operates (or continues) with safety and sustainability features; city evaluates impact and refines policy
5. Ongoing partnership: data, feedback, pilot extensions (e.g. charging docks, new zones)

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Context |
|--------|---------|
| Operator scale | 200+ cities (micromobility); largest in Europe |
| Battery operations (example) | 50–60 fewer battery swap operations per week in Tallinn with charging docks |
| Safety (2022) | 99.997% of scooter rides completed without safety incidents |
| Modal shift (claimed) | 12% of short car trips replaced by zero-emission scooter trips |
| EVs (2023) | 60% YoY growth in EVs on Bolt platform |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Better regulation with operator input; data for compliance and planning
- Safer streets: tandem prevention, reaction test, parking guidance, docks
- Cleaner streets and lower operational footprint (docks vs. van collections)
- Sustainability narrative (CarbonNeutral®, reduced congestion/emissions) for climate strategies
- Partnership tone: "We're here to help"; MaaS integration

## Proof Points

### Positioning
- "Our goal is to help cities find sustainable transport solutions, developing and sharing knowledge and real-time data to improve the lives of their citizens."
- "As the largest micromobility operator in Europe, we're happy to share our unique insights to help you draft effective micromobility regulation for your city."
- "Safety as a priority" — tandem prevention, reaction test, Beginner Mode, parking guidance, ambient noise for accessibility
- Charging docks: "We've already eliminated 50–60 battery swap operations per week in Tallinn"

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How are you currently designing or updating micromobility regulation — and do you have enough input from operators who operate at scale?
2. What data do you get from mobility operators today, and is it enough to monitor compliance and utilisation?
3. What are the biggest citizen or political concerns (parking, safety, clutter) and how are you addressing them?
4. How does shared mobility fit into your transport and climate goals — and what would "good" look like in 2–3 years?

### Demo / Meeting Focus Areas
- Regulation: fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data sharing (with examples from 200+ cities)
- Data: what Bolt can share for compliance and planning; real-time and best practices
- Safety: tandem prevention, reaction test, parking, docks, accessibility
- Sustainability: CarbonNeutral®, docks, modal shift, MaaS

### Key Talking Points
- "Rethinking urban transport — we're here to help"
- "Largest micromobility operator in Europe; 200+ cities"
- "Real-time data and best practices so you can monitor compliance and improve transport for your citizens"
- "Safety as a priority: unique safety features, charging docks that reduce clutter and operational footprint"
