# Use Case: Grow Fleet Revenue with Bolt

## Overview
Fleet owners who own vehicles want to increase utilisation and revenue without building their own app or managing multiple demand channels. Partnering with Bolt gives access to 200+ million riders and one dashboard to manage fleet assets—growing transport business with a single partner and clear demand.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Transport / fleet operators; own vehicles and want to fill capacity
- **Size**: Any (small fleet to larger operations)
- **Characteristics**: Need more demand; want to simplify operations and reporting; open to one primary partner

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Fleet owner / fleet manager
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Drivers (if applicable), finance (payouts)

### Trigger Event
- Fleet expansion or replacement; dissatisfaction with current platform(s); new fleet owner or manager; desire to maximise utilisation and simplify ops.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Vehicles underused; need more trips and predictable demand to cover fixed costs
- Multiple platforms or channels to fill capacity; fragmented reporting and payouts
- Building own app or demand is expensive and slow; hard to scale without proportionally increasing cost

### Desired State (After)
- Access to Bolt’s rider base so demand is predictable and scales with fleet
- One dashboard to manage assets and see utilisation/earnings
- Grow transport business with one partner; when demand is high, earn more
- Less time switching between systems; simpler operations

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Bolt (partnership / fleet programme)
- **Supporting**: Rides (demand side); fleet dashboard

### Solution Overview
Fleet owner partners with Bolt: connects fleet to Bolt’s platform; riders request rides and fleet supplies capacity. Manage assets from one easy-to-use dashboard; receive payouts and see utilisation. Bolt handles demand, app, and payments; fleet focuses on operations and growth. No need to build own app or chase multiple channels.

### Implementation Steps
1. Sign up as Bolt fleet partner; complete onboarding and compliance
2. Add vehicles to fleet; connect to Bolt’s system
3. Manage day-to-day from Bolt dashboard; riders send requests; when demand is high, earn more
4. Scale fleet or optimise utilisation using dashboard and Bolt demand
