# Use Case: Control and Reduce Team Travel Spend

## Overview
Companies need to cut travel costs and enforce spending policy without making it harder for employees to get to clients, the office, or the airport. Bolt Business delivers competitive pricing, custom spending limits and rules, and real-time visibility so travel and finance leads can reduce spend and stay in control—with one platform and one invoice.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any
- **Size**: Any; from small teams to large enterprises
- **Characteristics**: Under pressure to reduce or justify travel spend; want visibility and limits without hurting employee experience

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Business travel decision-maker (Travel Manager, Finance/Expenses Lead, Office Manager)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Finance (budget), Leadership (cost targets), Employees (convenience)

### Trigger Event
- Budget or cost-cutting initiative; new finance or travel lead; audit or compliance need; contract renewal; desire to "save budget for more important things."

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- No single view of travel spend; hard to set or enforce limits
- Trade-off between cost and convenience; risk of employee friction or shadow spending if policy is too tight
- Limited data on where savings are possible; reactive at budget review time
- Multiple providers or personal cards make it hard to negotiate or optimise

### Desired State (After)
- Custom spending limits and rules; real-time updates when team travels; organise employees into groups with specific limits
- Competitive pricing per journey; ability to identify cost-saving opportunities without compromising quality
- One platform and one invoice so spend is visible and controllable
- "Save your budget for more important things" while keeping travel reliable for the team

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Bolt Business (spending limits, rules, visibility, invoicing, competitive pricing)
- **Supporting**: Rides, Bolt Drive, Micromobility, Bolt Food for Business (all billable through one account)

### Solution Overview
Use Bolt Business to set custom spending limits and rules and organise team into groups. Team books work travel in Bolt; finance and travel get real-time visibility and one consolidated invoice. Competitive pricing per ride (and related services) helps identify savings without tightening policy so much that employees are blocked. Single platform simplifies negotiation and reporting.

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up Bolt Business account; add team members and define groups (e.g. by department, role, or budget)
2. Set spending and usage limits per group or globally as needed
3. Team books via Bolt app; travel/finance monitor real-time updates and monthly invoice
4. Review cost-saving opportunities (pricing, usage patterns); adjust limits or policy as needed
5. Use automated reports and integrations for finance and budget cycles
