# Use Case: Centralise Business Travel on One Platform

## Overview
Companies want to manage work travel (rides, car rental, micromobility, food) in one place—with one invoice, automated reports, and less admin. Bolt Business gives travel, office, and finance leads a single platform to control, monitor, and simplify business travel for the whole team, with no activation cost or minimum commitment.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any (Bolt Business: "businesses across any industry")
- **Size**: Small teams to large enterprises; 50,000+ businesses use Bolt Business
- **Characteristics**: Need to control travel spend; want to cut admin and simplify invoicing; open to one vendor for rides and related services

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Business travel decision-maker (Travel Manager, Office Manager, Finance/Expenses Lead, HR)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Employees (riders), Finance (invoicing), IT (integrations)

### Trigger Event
- Manual expense handling and scattered bookings; new travel or expense policy; finance pushing for visibility or savings; contract renewal with current provider; company growth (more employees travelling).

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Team books rides (and sometimes car rental, food) across multiple apps or personal cards
- Expenses land in different systems; travel manager or finance spends hours reconciling
- No single view of who travelled, how much was spent, or whether policy was followed
- Hard to set or enforce spending limits; surprises at month-end

### Desired State (After)
- One platform for work rides, Bolt Drive, e-scooters/e-bikes, Bolt Food for Business
- One consolidated invoice; automated ride reports and third-party integrations
- Full control: custom spending limits and rules, real-time updates when team travels
- Less admin; clear cost-saving opportunities without compromising employee experience

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Bolt Business (centralised account, invoicing, reports, limits, groups)
- **Supporting**: Rides, Bolt Drive, Micromobility, Bolt Food (consumed via Bolt Business)

### Solution Overview
Sign up for Bolt Business with company details and payment method; add team members and optionally set spend/usage limits and groups. Team books work travel in the Bolt app under the business account. All rides (and optionally Drive, scooters, food) appear on one invoice; automated reports and integrations reduce manual reconciliation. Custom limits and real-time visibility keep spend under control.

### Implementation Steps
1. Enter business details and preferred payment method; complete Bolt Business signup (no activation cost or minimum commitment)
2. Add team members; optionally organise into groups and set spending/usage limits per group
3. Team uses Bolt app for work rides (and Bolt Drive, scooters, Bolt Food for Business where available)
4. Use automated reports and third-party integrations for expense and finance workflows; review real-time visibility and adjust limits as needed
