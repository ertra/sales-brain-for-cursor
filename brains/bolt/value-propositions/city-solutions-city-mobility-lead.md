# City Solutions → City Mobility / Transport Lead Value Proposition

## Summary
City Solutions positions Bolt as a partner to cities: we share knowledge, real-time data, and best practices so you can design and enforce micromobility regulation, improve safety and parking, and advance sustainable transport. As the largest micromobility operator in Europe, we operate in 200+ cities and offer practical tools—e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, charging docks—plus safety features and data sharing. "Rethinking urban transport" and "We're here to help."

## The Problem
City mobility and transport leads struggle with drafting and enforcing micromobility rules, getting usable data from operators, managing safety and pavement parking, and reducing car dependency and emissions. They need a partner that operates at scale and is willing to share insights and data.

## The Solution
City Solutions delivers: (1) operator perspective and input on regulation (fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data sharing); (2) real-time data and best practices so cities can monitor compliance and plan; (3) safety and sustainability built in (tandem prevention, reaction test, parking guidance, charging docks, CarbonNeutral®); (4) integration with MaaS and willingness to work within local rules.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Regulation and policy input
- **Benefit**: Access to Bolt’s experience from 200+ cities to draft and refine micromobility regulation (street rental fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data requirements).
- **Proof Point**: "As the largest micromobility operator in Europe, we're happy to share our unique insights to help you draft effective micromobility regulation for your city."
- **Key Message**: "We share our insights so you can draft effective micromobility regulation—fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, enforcement."

### 2. Data for compliance and planning
- **Benefit**: Real-time data and willingness to share so municipalities can monitor regulatory compliance and make data-driven decisions.
- **Proof Point**: "Our goal is to help cities find sustainable transport solutions, developing and sharing knowledge and real-time data to improve the lives of their citizens"; operators "regularly share data so the municipality can monitor regulatory compliance."
- **Key Message**: "Real-time data and best practices so you can monitor compliance and improve transport for your citizens."

### 3. Safety and parking
- **Benefit**: Safety as priority: tandem prevention, cognitive reaction test (ride sober), Beginner Mode, parking guidance, AI pavement detection; charging docks reduce street clutter and operational footprint (e.g. 50–60 fewer battery swap operations per week in Tallinn).
- **Proof Point**: "Unique safety features, like our patented tandem riding prevention system, and a cognitive reaction test"; "Charging docks... encourage better parking habits and contribute to the overall cleanliness of the cityscape."
- **Key Message**: "Safety as a priority: unique safety features, rider education, responsible parking—and charging docks that reduce clutter and operational footprint."

### 4. Sustainability and modal shift
- **Benefit**: E-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, multimodal travel as tools to reshape city transport; CarbonNeutral® for scooters/e-bikes; reduced CO2 and congestion; support for climate and transport strategies.
- **Proof Point**: "12% of short-distance car trips replaced by zero-emission scooter trips"; "60% year-on-year growth in EVs on Bolt platform in 2023"; charging docks cut battery-swap van trips.
- **Key Message**: "Rethinking urban transport: tools for sustainable mobility—e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, multimodal—with sustainability built in."

## Quantified Value

| Metric | Context | Bolt Contribution |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| Operator scale | 200+ cities (micromobility) | Input and data from largest European micromobility operator |
| Battery operations | Tallinn example | 50–60 fewer battery swap operations per week with charging docks |
| Safety | 2022 | 99.997% of scooter rides completed without safety incidents |
| Modal shift | Claimed | 12% of short car trips replaced by zero-emission scooter trips |
| EVs | 2023 | 60% YoY growth in EVs on Bolt platform |

## ROI Story
- **For cities**: Better regulation and enforcement; data for planning and compliance; safer, cleaner streets; progress on climate and congestion goals; partnership with an operator that commits to data sharing and safety.
- **Payback**: Non-monetary ROI (policy quality, citizen satisfaction, sustainability); cities may gain revenue via street rental fees for micromobility.

## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"Your city needs to regulate micromobility and get real data from operators—without sacrificing safety or public space. Bolt is the largest micromobility operator in Europe, in 200+ cities. We share knowledge, real-time data, and best practices so you can draft effective regulation and monitor compliance. We've built in safety—tandem prevention, reaction tests, parking guidance, charging docks that reduce street clutter—and we're committed to sustainability. We're here to help. Let's rethink urban transport together."

### Email Subject Lines
- How Bolt helps cities design micromobility regulation (200+ cities)
- Real-time data and best practices for your city's mobility strategy
- Safety and sustainability: what Bolt offers cities
- We're here to help — Bolt City Solutions for sustainable mobility

### Key Phrases That Resonate
- "Rethinking urban transport"
- "Make cities for people, not cars"
- "We're here to help"
- "Largest micromobility operator in Europe"
- "200+ cities"
- "Real-time data and best practices"
- "Safety as a priority"
- "Sustainable mobility for cities"

### Phrases to Avoid
- Promising outcomes (e.g. exact % modal shift) without city-specific context
- "We know better than the city" — position as partner, not replacement for policy

## Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | Their Claim | Our Advantage |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Other micromobility operators | Scale, coverage | Bolt: 200+ cities, largest in Europe; charging docks; safety (tandem, reaction test); data-sharing and "we're here to help" positioning |
| No partnership | Cities regulate alone | Bolt offers operator perspective, data, and practical input; MaaS integration |
| Do Nothing | Status quo | Missed data, safety, and sustainability gains; harder to enforce and improve regulation |
