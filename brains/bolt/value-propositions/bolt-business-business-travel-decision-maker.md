# Bolt Business → Business Travel Decision-Maker Value Proposition

## Summary
Bolt Business gives travel, office, and finance leads one platform to control, monitor, and manage business travel worldwide. Save time with automated reports and integrations, cut travel costs with competitive pricing, and get full visibility and control with custom spending limits and a single invoice—with no activation cost or minimum commitment. 50,000+ businesses already use Bolt Business for work rides, car rental, micromobility, and food.

## The Problem
Business travel decision-makers face scattered bookings, manual expense handling, no single view of spend, and pressure to cut costs without hurting employee experience. They waste time reconciling receipts and reports, can’t set or enforce limits effectively, and lack data to find savings.

## The Solution
Bolt Business centralises work travel in one account: rides, Bolt Drive, e-scooters/e-bikes, Bolt Food for Business. Automated ride reports and third-party integrations reduce manual expenses; custom spending limits and rules with real-time updates give full control; one consolidated invoice and competitive pricing cut cost and admin. CarbonNeutral® for business rides supports sustainability messaging.
