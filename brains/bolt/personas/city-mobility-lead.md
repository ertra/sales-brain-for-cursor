# City Mobility / Transport Lead

## Role/Title
City Mobility Officer, Transport Planner, Head of Urban Mobility, Procurement or Policy lead for transport/micromobility. Person who shapes or implements how the city manages shared mobility (e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing) and sustainable transport.

## Responsibilities
- Define or influence local regulation and policy for micromobility and shared transport
- Improve sustainability, safety, and use of public space; reduce congestion and emissions
- Procure or oversee operators; set fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data requirements
- Balance innovation and citizen demand with compliance and public interest

## Company Profile
Municipalities, city transport departments, regional authorities — any city or region that has or is considering shared mobility (e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, MaaS). Bolt operates in 200+ cities for micromobility and positions City Solutions as a partner to “rethink urban transport.”

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Drafting and enforcing micromobility rules (parking, safety, fleet size, fees)
- Getting usable data from operators; monitoring compliance and utilisation
- Managing pavement parking and safety; citizen and political pressure
- Reducing car dependency and emissions while keeping transport convenient

## Goals & Objectives
- Sustainable, safe, and well-regulated shared mobility that fits public transport and walking/cycling
- Data and insights from a large operator to inform policy and enforcement
- Practical input on regulation: street rental fees, authorisations, utilisation targets, data sharing
- Cleaner streets, better parking behaviour, and reduced operational footprint (e.g. charging docks vs. van collections)

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **City Solutions**: Bolt shares knowledge, real-time data, and best practices; operator perspective from 200+ cities; tools: e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing, multimodal, charging docks; safety (tandem prevention, reaction test, parking guidance, accessibility); sustainability (CarbonNeutral®, reduced CO2, dock impact); “We’re here to help” / contact for cities.

## Buying Process
- B2G: procurement, policy, or pilot-driven; often long cycle; multiple stakeholders (transport, planning, legal, procurement)
- Values: data sharing, compliance, safety, sustainability, and willingness to work within local rules
- May evaluate multiple operators; Bolt’s scale in Europe and dock/safety story are differentiators

## Communication Preferences
- Outcomes: sustainable mobility, safety, data for decision-making, less clutter and emissions
- Proof: 200+ cities, charging docks (e.g. 50–60 fewer battery swaps/week in Tallinn), safety features (tandem detection, pavement detection), MaaS integration
- Tone: partnership, “rethinking urban transport,” “we’re here to help”

## Additional Notes
- City Solutions page emphasises managing micromobility (fees, authorisations, data, utilisation), safety, and sustainability. No explicit pricing; “Contact us” / “We’re here to help” suggests relationship and tender-driven sales.
