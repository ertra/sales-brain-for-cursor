# Fleet Owner

## Role/Title
Fleet Owner, Fleet Manager, Transport business owner. Runs a fleet of vehicles and partners with Bolt to access rider demand and manage operations.

## Responsibilities
- Manage fleet assets (cars, etc.) and maximise utilisation and revenue
- Choose platforms and partners to fill capacity; balance cost of operations with earnings
- Comply with local regulations and Bolt’s partner requirements
- Grow the transport business without necessarily adding owned vehicles

## Company Profile
Transport businesses that own vehicles and want to partner with Bolt; “Join Bolt with your fleet and earn more.” Manage assets from one dashboard; access Bolt’s rider base. Often treated as partners rather than classic B2B “accounts” — onboarding and partner success rather than enterprise sales.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Underused fleet; need more demand and predictable utilisation
- Managing multiple platforms or manual dispatch; want one dashboard
- Scaling the business without proportionally scaling fixed costs

## Goals & Objectives
- Grow revenue by connecting fleet to Bolt’s 200+ million riders
- Simplify operations with one easy-to-use dashboard for fleet management
- Increase earnings and asset productivity as a Bolt partner

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Bolt partnership**: Access to Bolt’s rider demand; one dashboard to manage assets; “grow your transport business”; no need to build own app or demand channel.

## Buying Process
- Partner onboarding rather than traditional enterprise sales; signup and compliance; may have dedicated partner/fleet team
- Cares about: ease of onboarding, dashboard usability, demand volume, payouts, and support

## Communication Preferences
- Outcomes: earn more, grow business, one dashboard, access to riders
- Proof: “200+ million riders,” “one easy-to-use dashboard,” “grow your transport business”

## Additional Notes
- Different from Bolt Business (company travel). Fleet owners supply capacity; Bolt Business buyers consume rides for their employees. This persona is for partner/BD context rather than primary “target company” buyer.
