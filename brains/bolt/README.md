## What This Is

This is a structured Sales Brain for **Bolt** focused on practical sales execution across:
- **B2B**: Bolt Business (company travel and mobility management)
- **B2G**: City Solutions (city mobility regulation, safety, sustainability, data)
- **Partner ecosystem**: fleet and marketplace participation

It captures company context, products, personas, pain points, value props, use cases, competitors, objections, case studies, and sales plays.

## Bolt in One Sentence

Bolt is the European mobility super-app that combines rides, food and grocery delivery, car-sharing, micromobility, and business travel to help people and organizations move with less friction and better control.

## Core Proof Points

| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Rider scale | 200M+ riders |
| Partner scale | 4.5M+ partners |
| Business adoption | 50,000+ businesses on Bolt Business |
| Geographic footprint | 600+ cities, 50+ countries |
| City/micromobility depth | 200+ cities (micromobility context) |
| Dock operations example | 50-60 fewer weekly battery-swap operations in Tallinn (charging dock example) |

## Key Differentiators

1. **Multi-service platform**: rides, Bolt Drive, scooters/e-bikes, and food/grocery workflows connected in one ecosystem.
2. **Business travel control**: custom limits/rules, real-time visibility, automated reporting, and consolidated invoicing.
