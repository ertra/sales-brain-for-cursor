# Competitor: Lime

## Overview
Lime is a global micromobility operator (e-scooters, e-bikes) in hundreds of cities. Cities often run tenders or permit rounds with multiple operators (e.g. Bolt, Lime, Tier, Voi, Dott). Bolt competes with Lime for city contracts, street space, and riders. For **City Solutions** (B2G), Bolt’s advantages include: super-app (rides + car-sharing + scooters + food) and City Solutions partnership (data, regulation input, safety, charging docks); European focus and "largest micromobility operator in Europe" positioning; CarbonNeutral® and sustainability narrative; charging docks to reduce street clutter and van operations.

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.li.me (or li.me)
- **Geography**: Global (Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific); Bolt strong in Europe and many of same cities
- **Offerings**: E-scooters, e-bikes; docked and dockless; rental via app
- **Scale**: Hundreds of cities worldwide; major player in US and Europe

## Product Overview (Micromobility)
- **E-scooters and e-bikes**: App-based rental; pay per ride or passes
- **Operations**: Fleet management, rebalancing, battery swap or charging; some markets have docks
- **Safety**: Speed limits, geofencing, rider education; varies by city
- **Sustainability**: Carbon-neutral or low-emission positioning in many markets; fleet renewal and recycling

## Positioning & Messaging (Typical)
- **Tagline**: Often "Green ride" / sustainable mobility; global brand
- **Target**: Consumers (riders); cities (permits, regulation)
- **Proof**: Trip counts, CO₂ saved, safety stats; city partnerships

## Strengths
- **Brand**: Strong global recognition in micromobility
- **Scale**: Large operator in many cities; experience with city tenders and regulation
- **Product**: Mature scooters and e-bikes; Gen4 and newer hardware; some markets with docking
- **Funding**: Well-funded; can compete on capex and city bids
- **Data**: Can provide trip and compliance data to cities where required

## Weaknesses (vs Bolt for City Solutions)
- **No super-app**: Lime is scooters/bikes only; Bolt offers rides + Bolt Drive + scooters + food in one app — cities may prefer one mobility partner for multimodal and MaaS
- **European footprint**: Bolt positions as "largest micromobility operator in Europe"; Lime strong but Bolt has European HQ and deep EU city relationships
- **Charging docks**: Bolt highlights docks (e.g. 50–60 fewer battery swap ops/week in Tallinn); reduces street clutter and van traffic; not all operators offer dock networks
- **B2G positioning**: Bolt City Solutions explicitly "we're here to help" and shares regulation input and best practices; Lime engages cities but Bolt frames partnership and data sharing as a product (City Solutions)
- **Safety narrative**: Bolt emphasises tandem prevention, cognitive reaction test, Beginner Mode, AI pavement detection; cities comparing operators may weight these
- **CarbonNeutral®**: Bolt scooters and e-bikes certified CarbonNeutral®; clear claim for sustainability-led procurement

## Competitive Battlecard (City Solutions)

### When We Win (Bolt)
- City wants **one mobility partner** for scooters and other modes (rides, car-sharing); Bolt super-app and City Solutions cover micromobility + broader mobility and data
- **Docks and clutter**: City cares about reducing street clutter and van operations; Bolt charging docks and "50–60 fewer battery swap operations per week" (Tallinn)
- **Safety and regulation**: City wants strong safety (tandem, reaction test, parking) and operator input on regulation; Bolt City Solutions frames partnership and best practices
- **European / sustainability**: City prefers European operator and CarbonNeutral®; Bolt HQ and certification
- **Data and compliance**: City wants clear data sharing and "we're here to help" posture; Bolt productises City Solutions

### When They Win (Lime)
- **Global brand**: City or procurement prefers globally recognised micromobility brand
- **Existing contract**: Already in multi-year agreement with Lime
- **Market-specific**: Lime has stronger fleet or coverage in that city or country
- **Hardware / product**: City favours Lime’s hardware or operational model in that market

### Key Differentiators (Bolt Advantages)
1. **Super-app + City Solutions**: Micromobility plus rides, Bolt Drive, food in one app; City Solutions as dedicated B2G offer (data, regulation, safety, sustainability)
2. **Charging docks**: Fewer van/bike battery operations; less clutter; concrete example (Tallinn)
3. **Safety**: Tandem prevention, reaction test, Beginner Mode, AI pavement detection — all highlighted for cities
4. **"Largest micromobility operator in Europe"** and European focus; CarbonNeutral® for scooters and e-bikes
5. **Partnership tone**: "We're here to help"; share insights and best practices from 200+ cities

## Handling Competitive Situations (Cities)
- **"We're considering Lime and Bolt"**: "Bolt is the largest micromobility operator in Europe and we offer more than scooters and e-bikes — rides and car-sharing in the same app, and City Solutions so we share data and best practices with you. We've invested in safety (tandem prevention, reaction test, charging docks) and CarbonNeutral® certification. We're here to help with regulation and compliance."
- **"Lime is already in our city"**: "Bolt can add capacity and choice, and we bring City Solutions — one partner for micromobility and broader mobility, with data sharing and regulation input. Our charging docks reduce street clutter and van operations. Happy to show how we'd complement or expand your current setup."
