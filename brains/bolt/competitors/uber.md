## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Bolt)
- Prospect wants **rides + car-sharing + micromobility + food** in one B2B contract; Bolt Business offers all in one app and one invoice; Uber for Business is rides + meals (+ delivery); micromobility and car-sharing are separate or limited for Uber
- **European HQ or operations**: Bolt is "first European mobility super-app"; strong in EU cities; CarbonNeutral® and City Solutions resonate with EU sustainability and B2G
- **Sustainability-led procurement**: Bolt Business rides and micromobility certified CarbonNeutral®; single narrative for travel + scooters/e-bikes
- **No commitment / pilot**: Prospect wants to try without minimum commitment; Bolt emphasises "no activation cost or minimum commitment" and quick start
- **City / B2G in scope**: Bolt can pair Bolt Business with City Solutions (data, regulation, micromobility) for cities; Uber less focused on city partnership in same way

### When They Win (Uber)
- **Global footprint**: Company needs same vendor in US, EU, and elsewhere; Uber's global scale and Fortune 500 penetration
- **Enterprise standard**: Already standardized on Uber for Business; expense integrations and workflows entrenched
- **Brand preference**: "We want Uber" for brand or employee preference
- **Uber Health / specific use cases**: Need healthcare or other Uber-specific products

### Key Differentiators (Bolt Advantages)
1. **Super-app in one contract**: Rides + Bolt Drive + scooters/e-bikes + Bolt Food for Business in one platform and one invoice; Uber for Business is rides + meals (+ delivery), not car-sharing or micromobility in same B2B product
2. **CarbonNeutral®**: Bolt Business rides and Bolt scooters/e-bikes certified CarbonNeutral®; clear sustainability story for EU and corporate tenders
3. **European mobility focus**: "First European mobility super-app"; 600+ cities, 50+ countries; City Solutions for B2G alongside B2B
4. **No minimum commitment**: Emphasised for fast pilot and expansion; 50,000+ businesses

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
