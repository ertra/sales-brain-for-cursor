# Business Travel Decision-Maker – Objection Handling

## Overview
Objections from travel, office, and finance leads evaluating Bolt Business. Focus on incumbent (Uber), cost, control, adoption, and integration. See [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for cross-cutting price, timing, and competition.

## Objections

### 1. "We already have expense integrations with Uber / our current provider"

**Why They Say This**:
Existing workflows with SAP, Concur, or other tools; don't want to redo integrations.

**Acknowledge**:
"Integrations are critical so finance doesn't have to re-enter data."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business has automated ride reports and third-party platform integrations so you can keep your expense workflow. We're built to feed into the systems you already use — the goal is to reduce manual reconciliation, not add it. I can confirm which integrations we support for your stack and how the flow would work. Which expense or ERP system do you use today?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Automated ride reports and third-party platform integrations, making manual expenses a thing of the past"
- One consolidated invoice reduces manual work regardless of downstream system

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Which systems do you need Bolt to connect to — and is that for reporting, coding, or both?"

### 2. "We need strict spending limits and approval workflows"

**Why They Say This**:
Policy compliance; finance or audit requirements; need to enforce by group or cost centre.

**Acknowledge**:
"Control and compliance are non‑negotiables for a lot of travel programs."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business is built for that. You set custom spending limits and rules and organise employees into groups with specific limits. You get real-time updates when the team travels, so you're not waiting for month-end to see overspend. There's no minimum commitment, so you can pilot with one group and tighten or relax rules as you learn. How do you currently enforce limits — by department, cost centre, or something else?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Set custom spending limits and rules"; "organise employees into groups with specific limits"
- "Real-time updates when your team travels"; "you stay in full control"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would 'full control' look like for you — per-person limits, per-group caps, or approval before first ride?"

### 3. "We need one solution for rides and car rental"

**Why They Say This**:
Team uses both taxis/rides and rental cars; want one vendor and one invoice.

**Acknowledge**:
"One provider for rides and rental simplifies everything."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business includes both: work rides and Bolt Drive car-sharing in the same app and on the same invoice. Employees don't switch apps; you get one consolidated bill and one set of reports. Bolt Drive is pay for time and distance or daily rate — no separate rental counter. So rides and car-sharing are in one Bolt Business account. Does your team need longer-term rental too, or mainly short-term and same-day?"

**Proof Point**:
- Bolt Business: work rides + Bolt Drive + scooters + Bolt Food for Business in one platform
- One invoice; one app for employees

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Today, how do you handle ride vs rental — two vendors and two invoices?"

---

### 4. "Sustainability matters for our travel policy"

**Why They Say This**:
CSR or net-zero goals; preference for green travel options.

**Acknowledge**:
"More companies are aligning travel with sustainability targets."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business rides on Business Accounts are certified CarbonNeutral®, and all Bolt scooter and e-bike rides are too. So when your team uses Bolt for work rides or micromobility, you can count that toward your sustainability reporting. We can share how that fits into your travel and carbon reporting. Do you report travel emissions today — and for which regions?"

**Proof Point**:
- Bolt Business (Business Accounts) rides certified CarbonNeutral®
- Scooters and e-bikes certified CarbonNeutral®
- "Make cities for people, not cars" — mission alignment

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Do you have a target for ground transport emissions — and would CarbonNeutral® rides and micromobility help you hit it?"

---

### 5. "We're a small team — is Bolt Business for us?"

**Why They Say This**:
Assume B2B travel is for large enterprises only; worried about minimums or complexity.

**Acknowledge**:
"Small teams need control and simplicity too."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business is for companies of any size. There's no activation cost or minimum commitment — you add your team, set limits if you want, and you get one invoice and the same controls whether you're 5 or 500 people. A lot of our customers started small and grew. You can start with one team or one country and expand when it makes sense. How many people would need to use it in the first phase?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Regardless of your company's size"; "no activation costs or minimum commitment"
- 50,000+ businesses — from small teams to large enterprises

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would 'easy' look like for your team — number of users, regions, and how you'd like to see spend?"
