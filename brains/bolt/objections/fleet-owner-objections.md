# Fleet Owner – Objection Handling

## Overview
Objections from fleet owners considering partnering with Bolt. Focus on demand, payouts, exclusivity, and operations. See [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for general themes.

## Objections

### 1. "We're already on Uber / another platform"

**Why They Say This**:
Existing relationship; don't want to split focus or add admin.

**Acknowledge**:
"You've got demand from your current partner."

**Respond**:
"Bolt adds another channel without replacing what you have. 200+ million riders use Bolt — in many cities that's a lot of demand, especially at peak. You manage your fleet from one Bolt dashboard; you're not juggling more apps than you do today. A lot of fleet partners run on more than one platform to maximise utilisation. We can show you demand and payouts in your area so you can decide if adding Bolt is worth it. How much of your capacity is filled by your current platform today?"

**Proof Point**:
- 200+ million riders; 600+ cities, 50+ countries
- One dashboard to manage assets

**Follow-Up Question**:
"In your city, do you see Bolt as a major rider app — and would a second channel help fill slack times?"

### 2. "What are the payouts / fees?"

**Why They Say This**:
Need to understand economics before committing.

**Acknowledge**:
"Economics drive the decision."

**Respond**:
"Payouts depend on your market and trip type. We can walk through the structure and typical earnings in your area so you can compare to what you get today. Bolt doesn't charge an activation fee to join — you're not locked in before you see real demand and payouts. Many partners run a trial period and then decide. What would you need to see in the first month to feel it's worth continuing?"

**Proof Point**:
- No activation fee; "when demand is high, you can earn even more"
- One dashboard; transparent trip and earnings view

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's your current utilisation and revenue per vehicle — and what would make adding Bolt worthwhile?"

---

### 3. "We don't want to be exclusive to Bolt"

**Why They Say This**:
Want to keep other platforms; fear of lock-in.

**Acknowledge**:
"Flexibility matters."

**Respond**:
"Bolt doesn't require exclusivity. You can partner with Bolt and keep your other channels — the goal is to give you more demand and a simple way to manage your fleet. You use the Bolt dashboard for Bolt trips; you're not giving up your other operations. Does your current partner require exclusivity?"

**Proof Point**:
- No exclusivity requirement stated; "join Bolt with your fleet and earn more"
- One dashboard for Bolt assets/trips

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Would you consider Bolt as an additional channel if there's no exclusivity and you keep your current setup?"
