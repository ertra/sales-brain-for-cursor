# City Mobility / Transport Lead – Objection Handling

## Overview
Objections from city mobility officers and transport leads evaluating Bolt (micromobility and City Solutions). Focus on incumbent operators, regulation, data, safety, and procurement. See [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for cross-cutting themes.

## Objections

### 1. "We already have Lime / Tier / another operator"

**Why They Say This**:
Existing permit or contract; don't want to add complexity or re-run tender.

**Acknowledge**:
"You've already invested in a micromobility program."

**Respond**:
"Bolt can add choice and capacity — and we bring something different: we're the largest micromobility operator in Europe and we offer more than scooters and e-bikes. In the same app we have rides and car-sharing, so we're a mobility partner, not just scooters. For cities, we have City Solutions: we share data and best practices and help with regulation. We've also invested in safety — tandem prevention, reaction tests, charging docks to reduce street clutter — and our scooters and e-bikes are CarbonNeutral®. We're happy to show how we'd complement your current setup or fit into a future tender. Are you planning to add operators or refresh permits soon?"

**Proof Point**:
- Largest micromobility operator in Europe; 200+ cities
- City Solutions: data, regulation input, "we're here to help"
- Charging docks (e.g. 50–60 fewer battery swap ops/week in Tallinn); CarbonNeutral®

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would make you consider adding another operator — capacity, coverage, safety, or data?"

---

### 2. "We need more data from operators before we can regulate"

**Why They Say This**:
Want trip data, compliance metrics, utilisation; current operators don't share enough.

**Acknowledge**:
"Data is essential for good policy and enforcement."

**Respond**:
"Bolt is committed to sharing data so you can monitor compliance and plan. City Solutions is built around that: real-time data and best practices so you see what's happening on the ground. We operate in 200+ cities and we're used to working with municipalities on authorisations, utilisation targets, and data requirements. We can outline what we share and how often — and how it fits your existing data or reporting needs. What data do you currently get from operators, and what's missing?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Developing and sharing knowledge and real-time data to improve the lives of their citizens"
- "Operators must... regularly share data so the municipality can monitor regulatory compliance"
- "We're here to help"

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Which metrics matter most for you — trips, parking compliance, utilisation, or emissions?"

---

### 3. "Safety and parking are our biggest concerns"

**Why They Say This**:
Citizen complaints; political pressure; pavement parking and incidents.

**Acknowledge**:
"Safety and parking make or break public support."

**Respond**:
"Safety is a priority for Bolt. We have patented tandem riding prevention, a cognitive reaction test so people don't ride under the influence, Beginner Mode for new riders, and AI that helps with pavement detection and parking guidance. We also use charging docks where we can — that means fewer vans and cargo bikes doing battery swaps, so less clutter and fewer vehicles on the street. In Tallinn we cut 50–60 battery swap operations per week. We're happy to walk through our safety toolkit and how we educate riders and handle parking. What are the main safety or parking issues you're seeing today?"

**Proof Point**:
- Tandem prevention; reaction test; Beginner Mode; AI pavement detection and parking guidance
- Charging docks: 50–60 fewer battery swap ops/week in Tallinn; "better parking habits"
- 99.997% of scooter rides completed without safety incidents (2022)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Would dock-based parking or stricter in-app parking rules help in your city?"

---

### 4. "We're not ready to run a new tender"

**Why They Say This**:
Tender cycle is long; no budget or capacity; current contracts in place.

**Acknowledge**:
"Tenders take time and resources."

**Respond**:
"You don't have to run a new tender tomorrow. We can start with a conversation: share what we're doing on safety, data, and sustainability, and how we work with cities in 200+ places. When you're ready to refresh permits or add operators, you'll have a clear picture of Bolt. We're here to help with regulation and best practices whether or not we're in your city yet. Would it be useful to have a non-commercial session on micromobility regulation and what other cities are doing?"

**Proof Point**:
- City Solutions: "We're here to help"; share insights from 200+ cities
- No obligation; relationship and input can start before any tender

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When do you expect your next permit or tender cycle — and who else would need to be involved?"

---

### 5. "Why should we choose Bolt over Lime / Tier / others?"

**Why They Say This**:
Comparing operators; need clear differentiators for procurement or policy.

**Acknowledge**:
"You have to compare like for like."

**Respond**:
"Bolt is the largest micromobility operator in Europe and we're a mobility super-app: in the same app we have rides, car-sharing, scooters, and food. So we're not just scooters — we're a single mobility partner for the city. We've invested in City Solutions: we share data and best practices and help with regulation. On safety we have tandem prevention, reaction tests, and charging docks to reduce street clutter. Our scooters and e-bikes are CarbonNeutral®. So the choice is: do you want a scooter-only operator, or a mobility partner that does scooters, rides, and car-sharing and works with you on data and regulation? We're here to help either way."

**Proof Point**:
- Super-app: rides + Drive + scooters + food; City Solutions for B2G
- Largest in Europe; 200+ cities; safety (tandem, reaction test, docks); CarbonNeutral®

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would make Bolt the right fit for your city — coverage, safety, data, or sustainability?"
