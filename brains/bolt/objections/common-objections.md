# Common Objections (Bolt)

## Overview
Cross-cutting objections for Bolt Business and City Solutions: competition (Uber), price/ROI, timing, geography, and adoption. See persona-specific files for role-deep objections.

## Objections

### 1. "We're already using Uber for Business"

**Why They Say This**:
Incumbent relationship; employees know Uber; expense integrations and processes already in place.

**Acknowledge**:
"Uber for Business is a strong product and a lot of companies use it."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business adds a few things in one place that Uber for Business doesn't: car-sharing (Bolt Drive) and micromobility (scooters and e-bikes) on the same invoice and in the same app as rides and Bolt Food. So if you want work rides plus car rental and scooters for the team in one contract — and one consolidated invoice — Bolt can do that. We also don't have a minimum commitment: you can pilot with one team or location and see the fit. And in Europe, Bolt is the mobility super-app many employees already use. Would it help to run a small pilot alongside Uber for European travel or for rides + scooters + car-sharing?"

**Proof Point**:
- 50,000+ businesses use Bolt Business; one platform for rides, Bolt Drive, scooters, Bolt Food for Business
- No activation cost or minimum commitment
- CarbonNeutral® for business rides and micromobility (if sustainability matters)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where is Uber for Business falling short — is it coverage in certain cities, car-sharing, micromobility, or something else?"

---

### 2. "We need a global solution / Uber is everywhere"

**Why They Say This**:
Company operates in many countries; want one vendor for all regions; Uber’s scale (200k+ companies, Fortune 500).

**Acknowledge**:
"Global consistency is important when you have teams in multiple regions."

**Respond**:
"For European operations and the 50+ countries where Bolt runs, we're often the preferred local option — and we give you one platform for rides, car-sharing, and micromobility there. A lot of companies use Uber in the US and Bolt in Europe so they get the best of both: global coverage with the right product per region. Bolt Business works the same way wherever we operate: one dashboard, one invoice, cost controls, and no minimum commitment. If you'd like, we can map where Bolt fits your footprint and where you might keep Uber or another provider."

**Proof Point**:
- Bolt: 600+ cities, 50+ countries; first European mobility super-app
- Same Bolt Business product across Bolt markets; 50,000+ businesses

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Which regions matter most for business travel right now — and are any of them Bolt cities?"

---

### 3. "What does it cost? / We can't justify the cost"

**Why They Say This**:
Budget pressure; need to show ROI; unclear pricing or comparison to current spend.

**Acknowledge**:
"Cost and ROI are top of mind for travel and finance."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business is pay-per-use: you pay for the rides and services your team actually use, with competitive pricing and no activation cost or minimum commitment. So you're not adding a fixed cost — you're consolidating spend onto one platform and one invoice, with full visibility and control. Many customers save time on admin and reconciliation and find cost-saving opportunities because they finally see all travel in one place. We can walk through your current travel spend and show how Bolt Business pricing and controls would look for your team. What are you spending today on ground transport and how is it billed?"

**Proof Point**:
- No activation cost or minimum commitment
- Competitive pricing; "identify cost-saving opportunities without compromising quality"
- One invoice; automated reports and integrations (less admin cost)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"How much time does finance or travel spend today reconciling ride and travel expenses — and what would one invoice and automated reports be worth?"

---

### 4. "We're not ready to switch / Maybe next quarter"

**Why They Say This**:
No urgency; other priorities; fear of change or migration.

**Acknowledge**:
"Timing is always a factor."

**Respond**:
"That's why we don't have a minimum commitment. You can add Bolt Business for one team or one country as a pilot — same controls, one invoice — and see how it fits. No need to switch everything at once. If it works, you expand; if not, you haven't locked in. A lot of customers start with a single department or region and grow from there. What would need to be true for you to feel comfortable trying Bolt for one slice of travel?"

**Proof Point**:
- No activation cost or minimum commitment; "quick and easy to get started"
- 50,000+ businesses; can start small and scale

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Is there a team or region where you'd be open to a low-risk pilot — and what would make that a success for you?"

---

### 5. "Our employees prefer Uber / Will they use Bolt?"

**Why They Say This**:
Brand familiarity; concern about adoption or pushback.

**Acknowledge**:
"Employee preference matters for travel programs."

**Respond**:
"In many European cities, Bolt is the app people already use for rides and food — so adoption is often smooth. Bolt Business works like consumer Bolt: same app, same experience; employees just choose the business profile for work trips. You get one invoice and full control; they get a familiar app. If you're rolling out in Bolt-heavy markets, we can share adoption tips and make sure the business profile is easy to find. Are your employees mainly in Europe or also in other Bolt markets?"

**Proof Point**:
- 200M+ riders; Bolt app already used daily in 600+ cities
- Same app for work (business profile) and personal; no second app to learn

**Follow-Up Question**:
"In which cities do your team travel most — and do they already use Bolt there for personal trips?"

---

### 6. "We need to see ROI / Proof before we commit"

**Why They Say This**:
Need to justify to finance or leadership; past disappointments with other vendors.

**Acknowledge**:
"Proof and ROI are fair expectations."

**Respond**:
"Bolt Business delivers ROI in a few ways: less admin through one invoice and automated reports, better visibility so you can set and enforce limits, and competitive pricing so you can cut cost without tightening policy too much. We don't lock you in — no minimum commitment — so you can run a pilot and measure time saved and spend before/after. We can also share how other companies use us for control and cost (50,000+ businesses). What would count as proof for your finance or leadership — time saved, spend reduction, or both?"

**Proof Point**:
- 50,000+ businesses; no minimum commitment so pilot is low risk
- Value: save time (reports, integrations), cut costs (competitive pricing), full control (limits, visibility)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would you need to measure in a pilot to call it a success — and over what period?"
