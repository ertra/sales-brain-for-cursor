# Bolt Drive

## Company
Bolt

## Overview
Bolt Drive is car-sharing on demand: rent a car at the tap of a button, unlock with the app, pay for time and distance (or daily rate). No service checks, insurance forms, or parking fees; find a car on the street or via the in-app map. Part of the same Bolt app as rides and other services.

## Main Features
- **On demand**: Find car nearby, unlock with phone, drive; park for free in designated areas
- **Pay as you go**: Pay for time and distance driven; or daily rentals with fixed fee (fuel and parking not included)
- **Car types**: Everyday cars, SUVs, vans and trucks, luxury; automatic transmission at no extra cost; availability varies by location
- **Flow**: Create account → verify licence in app → find car on map → unlock with app → end trip (park, leave key)
- **Reserve**: Free short reservation to reach the car; small fee after that
- **Third-party cars**: Some regions offer cars from third parties via Bolt Drive

## Problem Solved
Need for a car for minutes or days without owning one, dealing with rental counters, or worrying about parking costs in designated areas.

## Value Proposition
"Why drive when you can Drive?" — Rent faster than finding a parking space; drive as long as needed; park for free and move on. Low rates, new cars, no extra paperwork in-app.

## Target Customers
Urban users who need a car occasionally (errands, longer trips, cargo); people who want flexibility without ownership or traditional rental hassle.

## Pricing Model
Time + distance or daily fixed rate; check app for local options. Payment as for other Bolt services (card, Apple Pay in app).
