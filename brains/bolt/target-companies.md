# Target Companies

## Overview
Bolt’s sales-relevant “target companies” split into **B2B** (Bolt Business) and **B2G** (City Solutions). Bolt Business serves 50,000+ businesses of any size and industry for work travel (rides, car rental, micromobility, food). City Solutions targets municipalities and transport authorities that want sustainable mobility, micromobility regulation, and data. Consumer riders and earn-side partners (drivers, couriers, merchants, fleet owners) are acquired via product and growth, not classic B2B sales.
