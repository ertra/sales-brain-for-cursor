# Case Study: Cyera

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Cyera |
| **Industry** | Data security |
| **Company Size** | Fast-growing; 100+ sales reps |
| **Products Used** | Apollo (data + engagement + sequences + workflows + Salesforce integration); replaced legacy sales engagement platform and fragmented data |
| **Primary Persona** | Sales Leader (Global Director of Business Development) |
| **Use Case** | Scale outbound without headcount; consolidate stack; reduce manual work; increase meetings |

## Executive Summary
Cyera’s rapid growth left them with a fractured sales stack: nearly 500 unorganized sequences, poor integration between data provider, sales engagement, and Salesforce, and too much manual work. Andrew Froning, Global Director of Business Development, led a phased rollout of Apollo. Results: 4+ hours saved daily across the team, 50% reduction in manual work, 75% more meetings booked, 2x more sales conversations (1+ min). One source of truth and one platform replaced clutter and waste.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Data security; "one of the fastest-growing data security companies in the world"
- **Size**: 100+ sales reps; explosive growth
- **Location**: (Not specified in story)
- **Business Model**: B2B; enterprise data security

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Andrew inherited a sales tech stack with nearly 500 unorganized sequences, no clear structure or way to read the data, and difficulty understanding what was working. Poor integration between data provider, sales engagement platform, and Salesforce. Too many manual processes; system errors and missed opportunities including workable leads. "Cyera's remarkable growth was both a blessing and a curse — the rapid pace of expansion meant that sales processes weren't able to keep up."

### Key Pain Points
- ~500 sequences with no organization or structure
- Fragmented tools: data provider, sales engagement, Salesforce—poor integration and communication
- Manual processes eating valuable selling time
- Missed opportunities and workable leads due to system errors
- No single source of truth; "hard to understand what was working and what wasn't"

### Business Impact
- Wasted time and missed opportunities
- BDR productivity limited by tool clutter and manual work
- Growth outpacing infrastructure; "if your sales infrastructure not only doesn't support growth — but actively hampers it — you're dead in the water"

### What They Tried Before
- Legacy sales engagement platform (hundreds of sequences, no governance)
- Multiple vendors (e.g. evaluated Salesloft, Groove, Outreach); chose Apollo after hearing about product investments and "shaking things up"

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Us
- **Data + engagement in one**: Apollo’s investments in a unified platform; "one source of truth."
- **Community and product momentum**: "I kept hearing more and more in the community that Apollo was making big investments and shaking things up."
- **Comprehensive workflow**: Solve organization and process first; impact spreads to entire workflow—"every aspect of your workflow improves with it."
- **Phased rollout**: BDR pilot → process refinement (workshops, templates, SOPs) → full rollout to 100+ reps; "BDRs as POCs" for morale and adoption.

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Apollo Data + Outbound | Centralized clean data; sequences; efficient engagement; automated recurring work |
| Apollo (platform) | Single source of truth; integration with Salesforce; workflows; reporting |
| Deal Execution (implied) | Call insights; follow-up; less manual work (50% reduction) |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: BDR pilot; train core group as power users and POCs for full rollout.
- **Phase 2**: Process refinement; quarterly workshops; templated sequences, folder structure, SOPs; "get things to a point where it was humming."
- **Phase 3**: Full rollout to 100+ reps; system built so rollout was manageable.
- **Time to Value**: 4+ hours saved daily; 75% more meetings; 50% less manual work; 2x conversations.

## The Results

## Sales Use

### Best For
This case study works best when selling to:

- **Persona**: Sales Leader (BDR Leader, Director of Business Development)
- **Industry**: B2B; high-growth; data/security/tech
- **Company Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; 20+ to 100+ reps
- **Use Case**: Scale outbound; consolidate stack; reduce manual work; clean up sequences and tool sprawl

### Key Talking Points
1. 75% more meetings and 50% less manual work—same team, one platform.
2. Replaced ~500 unorganized sequences and fragmented tools with one source of truth; 4+ hours saved daily across team.
3. Phased rollout (BDR pilot → process refinement → full rollout) de-risks adoption for large teams.

### Objections This Addresses
- "We need more SDRs" → 75% more meetings and 50% less manual work with current team.
- "Our reps are used to current tools" → Cyera had a "mess"; Apollo gave clarity and adoption with BDRs as POCs.
- "Switching is too disruptive" → Phased rollout and "humming" process before full rollout.
