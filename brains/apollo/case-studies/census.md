# Case Study: Census

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Census |
| **Industry** | Reverse ETL / data activation |
| **Company Size** | High-growth; Sequoia, a16z, Insight, Tiger Global backing; $60M+ Series B (2022) |
| **Products Used** | Apollo (data + sales engagement); replaced ZoomInfo and Outreach |
| **Primary Persona** | Revenue Operations (Head of Growth & Operations) |
| **Use Case** | Replace ZoomInfo + Outreach; improve data quality; cut cost; one platform for GTM |

## Executive Summary
Census was on Outreach and ZoomInfo and hit data accuracy and usability issues. At renewal they benchmarked ZoomInfo vs. Apollo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless—Apollo won on all fronts, especially enrichment. They replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach with Apollo, achieving 50% more email addresses, 400% more phone numbers, 50% increased data quality, and 64% cost savings. Migration took a matter of weeks.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Reverse ETL; data activation; "one of the world's leading reverse ETL firms"
- **Size**: High-growth; seed from a16z, $16M Series A (Sequoia), $60M Series B (Insight, Tiger, 2022)
- **Location**: (Not specified in story)
- **Business Model**: B2B; help teams unlock product data and incorporate it into sales and marketing

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Census ran Outreach (sales engagement) and ZoomInfo (sales intelligence) with a CRM. Three tools meant a training and enablement headache: find leads in ZoomInfo, add to CRM, add to sequence in Outreach—time-consuming and manual. Data accuracy was a problem: "ZoomInfo's data was unreliable and often out of date." Usability and data issues reduced team productivity.

### Key Pain Points
- Three tools (CRM, Outreach, ZoomInfo); manual process to move leads across systems
- ZoomInfo data unreliable and often out of date
- Training and enablement burden; small team had to navigate multiple systems
- No single source of truth for leads and engagement

### Business Impact
- Lower productivity; wasted time on manual steps and bad data
- Slower pipeline; inability to contact the right prospects reliably
- Higher cost ($18K Outreach + ~$15K ZoomInfo = ~$33K+ before Apollo)

### What They Tried Before
- Outreach + ZoomInfo as the "go-to" stack
- Worked "ok" at first; as they grew, problems grew
- Led to formal benchmark at renewal (ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit, Lusha, Seamless)

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Us
- **Benchmark winner**: "We benchmarked ZoomInfo versus Apollo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless, and ultimately Apollo won on all fronts, especially in enrichment. Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit."
- **Data quality**: Ability to find the right leads quickly and keep CRM up to date.
- **All-in-one**: Apollo provided sales engagement (dialer, sequences) comparable to Outreach/SalesLoft, so one tool replaced two.
- **Cost**: "We paid less for one tool than for two tools together... We cut our costs in half." (Outreach $18K + ZoomInfo ~$15K → Apollo $12K; ~$33K → $12K.)
- **Migration**: "From a technology point of view, it was a very simple migration — a matter of weeks. Nothing crazy."

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Apollo Data | Contact and company data; enrichment; 50% more emails, 400% more phone numbers; data quality |
| Apollo (Outbound / engagement) | Sequences, dialer; replaced Outreach; one platform for inbound and outbound |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Decision**: At ZoomInfo/Outreach renewal; ran benchmark and chose Apollo.
- **Implementation**: Started with inbound sales team on Apollo; expanded scope; "matter of weeks."
- **Time to Value**: Quick; simple migration; immediate cost and quality gains.

## The Results

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Email addresses | Baseline | More coverage | 50% more email addresses |
| Phone numbers | Baseline | More coverage | 400% more phone numbers |
| Data quality | ZoomInfo "unreliable, out of date" | Apollo | 50% increased data quality |
| Cost (Outreach + ZoomInfo) | ~$33K | Apollo ~$12K | 64% cost savings |

### Headline Results

- **400% more phone numbers**: Dramatically more reach.
- **50% increased data quality**: Versus ZoomInfo; Apollo won benchmark.
- **64% cost savings**: From ~$33K (two tools) to ~$12K (one tool).

### Qualitative Benefits
- One platform for data and engagement; no switching between ZoomInfo and Outreach
- Simple migration; "matter of weeks"
- Entire GTM team set up for growth with one source of truth
- "We cut our costs in half"

### On cost
> "We were paying Outreach $18,000. ZoomInfo must have been another $15,000. When we did the migration Apollo was $12,000. We paid less for one tool than for two tools together. We basically went from paying $35,000 for two tools to $12,000 for one. We cut our costs in half."
