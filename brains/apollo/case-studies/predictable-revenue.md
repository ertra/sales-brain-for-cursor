# Case Study: Predictable Revenue

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Predictable Revenue |
| **Industry** | Sales development training / consulting / SDRs for hire |
| **Company Size** | SMB; built SDR function at 55+ companies, tens of thousands of meetings booked |
| **Products Used** | Apollo (data + sales engagement + sequences + account management); replaced ZoomInfo, Outreach, Salesforce dependency |
| **Primary Persona** | Sales Leader (CEO) |
| **Use Case** | Consolidate sales tech stack; reduce cost; increase functionality and productivity |

## Executive Summary
Predictable Revenue was paying for ZoomInfo, Outreach, and Salesforce—and still weren’t getting the results they needed. They consolidated to Apollo for data, engagement, and account management, cutting cost by over 50% while increasing functionality. Results: 50% cost savings, 20% decrease in SDR workload, 2x open rate, 50% decrease in time to meeting.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Sales development training and consulting; SDRs for hire; methodology (e.g. "Predictable Revenue" / "Sales Bible of Silicon Valley")
- **Size**: SMB; built sales development at 55+ companies; helped book tens of thousands of meetings
- **Location**: (Not specified in story)
- **Business Model**: B2B; consulting, coaching, outsourced SDRs; methodology and process focus

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Predictable Revenue used Outreach (sales engagement) and ZoomInfo (data), plugged into Salesforce. As a sales development agency, they needed to manage sub-accounts, account rulesets, and reporting. The combination forced reliance on expensive Salesforce admins for what should have been self-serve. They even built their own supplementary tool for dashboards, reporting, and SDR performance so they could drop Salesforce licenses and pull from Outreach—using multiple tools was so expensive that building a custom tool was "cheaper" than keeping the Salesforce integration.

### Key Pain Points
- Three tools (ZoomInfo, Outreach, Salesforce) with high combined cost and complexity
- Dependence on pricey Salesforce admins for basic configuration
- No single place for data + engagement + account management
- Custom build required to reduce cost, indicating stack was unsustainable

### Business Impact
- High fixed cost for data, engagement, and CRM
- SDR productivity limited by tool fragmentation and admin dependency
- Slower time to meeting and lower open/reply potential with disconnected workflow

### What They Tried Before
- Outreach + ZoomInfo + Salesforce ("best practices everyone recommended")
- Custom internal tool for dashboards and reporting to reduce Salesforce spend
- Still not getting the results they needed; stack "was never going to cut it"

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Us
- **Integration of data and engagement**: "Apollo's integration between sales data and sales engagement and the magic that you can make happen when those two are together on the same platform."
- **One end-to-end tool**: Create sequences, layer prospecting data with account rulesets, manage accounts—all in one place.
- **Cost**: Apollo could be "a third of the cost" of ZoomInfo + Outreach + Salesforce + admins.
- **Ease and speed**: Reps could find ICP, start calling, and book meetings on day one without complex setup.

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Apollo Data + Outbound | Prospecting data, sequences, account rulesets, outreach |
| Apollo (platform) | Account management, reporting, single place for SDR workflow; replaced ZoomInfo, Outreach, and heavy Salesforce dependency |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Decision**: Colleague suggested trying Apollo after frustration with existing stack.
- **Implementation**: "Hit the ground running"—new sequences, data, account rules, all in one place.
- **Time to Value**: Immediate; story of SDR booking two meetings on first day using Apollo and ICP.

## The Results

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Tech stack cost | ZoomInfo + Outreach + Salesforce + admins | Apollo (single platform) | 50%+ cost savings |
| SDR workload | Higher (multi-tool, admin dependency) | Lower | 20% decrease in SDR workload |
| Open rate | Baseline | 2x | 2x increase |
| Time to meeting | Baseline | Faster | 50% decrease |

### Headline Results
- **50% cost savings**: Dropped ZoomInfo and Outreach; Apollo "could be a third of the cost" of full previous stack.
- **2x open rate**: Higher reply and open rates with Apollo.
- **50% decrease in time to meeting**: Speed to booking a meeting cut in half.
- **20% decrease in SDR workload**: Less complexity and admin.

### Qualitative Benefits
- End-to-end sales process in one tool; no custom build required
- Reps can self-serve; reduced dependency on Salesforce admins
- Day-one productivity (e.g. SDR booking two meetings on first day)
- "We reduced the complexity of three tools into one"
