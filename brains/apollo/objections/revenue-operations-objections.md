# Revenue Operations - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from RevOps (Revenue Operations, Sales Ops, GTM Ops) and how to handle them with Apollo-specific proof and follow-ups.

## Objections

### 1. Data Quality / Source of Truth: "We've standardized on ZoomInfo / Clearbit for data"

**Why They Say This**: Invested in incumbent; worry about migration and quality.

**Acknowledge**: "Standardizing on one data source is the right goal. So is quality and cost."

**Respond**: "Apollo can be that single source. We have 210M+ contacts, 91% email accuracy, and 65+ data points with real-time verification. Census benchmarked ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless and chose Apollo—higher enrichment quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit, and they cut costs in half. Built In enriches 100k leads daily and says they don’t have to touch it. One platform for data and engagement means one integration and one source of truth for routing and CRM."

**Proof Point**:
- Census: "Apollo won on all fronts, especially in enrichment"; 50% data quality increase, half the cost
- Built In: 100k leads enriched daily; "we don't really have to touch it"
- 91% email accuracy; real-time refresh

**Follow-Up Question**: "Have you run a data quality or enrichment benchmark lately? Many teams see 50%+ improvement and lower cost when they compare."

---

### 2. Price/Budget: "Apollo doesn't fit our procurement / budget process"

**Why They Say This**: Contract structure; need to show savings; or budget already allocated elsewhere.

**Acknowledge**: "Procurement and budget process matter."

**Respond**: "Apollo typically reduces total spend because we replace multiple line items. Census cut tech stack cost 64% by moving from ZoomInfo + Outreach to Apollo. Predictable Revenue saved 50% going from three tools to one. So the business case is consolidation and savings, not new budget. We have SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001; we work with Fortune 500 and offer Custom plans for security and API. We can provide a one-pager for finance showing current stack cost vs. one Apollo plan."

**Proof Point**:
- 64% lower tech stack (Census); 50% savings (Predictable Revenue)
- Compliance: SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001; Custom plans (company.md)

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would finance or procurement need to see to approve a consolidation—ROI, security docs, or something else?"

---

### 3. Timing: "We're not renewing for another 12 months"

**Why They Say This**: Contract lock-in; no urgency.

**Acknowledge**: "Renewal timing drives a lot of these decisions."

**Respond**: "Makes sense. When you’re 3–6 months from renewal, that’s the right time to run a pilot and compare. You can start with Apollo’s free tier or a trial—no new contract—and test data quality, enrichment, and CRM sync alongside what you have. When renewal comes, you’ll have real data on quality and cost. We can set a follow-up for when you’re closer to renewal and leave you with a comparison template."

**Proof Point**:
- Free tier and trial = no commitment before renewal
- Census, Built In, Leadium outcomes for when they’re ready

**Follow-Up Question**: "When is your next data or engagement renewal, and can we put a reminder to revisit then?"

---

### 4. Competition: "We're evaluating ZoomInfo / Clearbit / Lusha for enrichment"

**Why They Say This**: RFP or renewal; comparing enrichment and data vendors.

**Acknowledge**: "Comparing vendors is the right approach."

**Respond**: "Include Apollo in the comparison. We’re not just enrichment—we’re data plus outbound plus inbound plus deal execution, so you get one source of truth and one integration. On enrichment alone, Census chose us over ZoomInfo and Clearbit for higher quality and half the cost. Built In enriches 100k leads daily with minimal touch. If you’re also buying or renewing sequences and dialer, one Apollo contract often replaces data and engagement and cuts cost 50%+."

**Proof Point**:
- Census: benchmark vs. ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, Seamless; Apollo won; 50% data quality gain, half the cost
- Built In: 100k enriched daily; one platform

**Follow-Up Question**: "Are you evaluating enrichment only, or data and engagement together? That changes the ROI."

---

### 5. Status Quo: "Our integrations are built around our current stack"

**Why They Say This**: Sunk cost in integrations; fear of rework.

**Acknowledge**: "Integrations are critical. No one wants to rebuild everything."

**Respond**: "Apollo syncs with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft, Marketo, and more—so chances are we plug into what you already use. One platform means fewer integrations to maintain, not more. Census and others replaced ZoomInfo and Outreach with Apollo and unified around one integration. We have API and Custom plans for enterprise needs. We can map your current stack to Apollo and show what stays, what consolidates, and what gets simpler."

**Proof Point**:
- Integrations: Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft, Marketo (products, pricing)
- Census: replaced two vendors with one; 64% lower tech stack
- API and Custom plans for enterprise

**Follow-Up Question**: "Which systems do you need to keep in sync—CRM, outreach tool, enrichment? We can show the mapping."

---

### 6. Authority: "I need security / legal / procurement to approve"

**Why They Say This**: Real governance; enterprise process.

**Acknowledge**: "Security and procurement have to be comfortable."

**Respond**: "We’re built for that. We’re SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA, ISO 27001 compliant and work with Fortune 500 companies. We have a privacy center and Custom plans for governance and API. I can send our security and compliance overview and a one-pager for procurement showing consolidation and savings. If you have a security questionnaire or RFP, we can fill it out."

**Proof Point**:
- Compliance: GDPR, SOC 2, CCPA, ISO 27001, CASA Tier 2, etc. (company.md)
- Enterprise: Ernst & Young, Oracle, Lyft (pricing FAQ); Custom plans

**Follow-Up Question**: "What does security or procurement need—questionnaire, SOC report, or something else?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "How many data and enrichment vendors do you have today, and what’s the combined cost?"
2. "When do your data and engagement contracts renew?"
3. "Who signs off on vendor changes—just RevOps, or security, legal, procurement?"
4. "Is the goal to add a tool or to consolidate and reduce cost?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We’re ZoomInfo-wide for 2 more years" (note renewal; stay in touch)
- "We only need enrichment, not sequences" (still position one source of truth and cost if they have Outreach/Salesloft)
- "We have a 50-page security questionnaire" (offer to complete; we’re enterprise-ready)
