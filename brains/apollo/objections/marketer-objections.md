# Marketer - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from Marketers (Demand Gen, Growth, Marketing Ops, CMO) and how to handle them with Apollo-specific proof and follow-ups for Inbound and data/enrichment.

## Objections

### 1. Inbound / Routing: "We have a lead routing tool already"

**Why They Say This**: Incumbent in place; don’t see need to change; or haven’t seen Apollo’s full stack.

**Acknowledge**: "If routing is working, that’s important. The question is speed and data."

**Respond**: "Apollo Inbound does routing plus visitor ID, form enrichment, and scheduling—all on the same 210M-contact database your sales team uses. So you’re not adding a second data source; marketing and sales share one. We’ve seen 300% routing accuracy improvement and higher conversion when hot leads get enriched and routed in seconds. If your current tool is slow or uses different data than sales, that’s where Apollo helps: one platform, one data layer, don’t let hot leads go cold."

**Proof Point**:
- 300% routing accuracy improvement (Apollo case)
- Visitor ID, form enrichment, instant routing, scheduler (Inbound product)
- Same Apollo Data for outbound and inbound

**Follow-Up Question**: "When a high-intent lead comes in, how long until the right rep touches them—and is that data coming from the same source sales uses?"

---

### 2. Price/Budget: "We don't have budget for another marketing tool"

**Why They Say This**: Budget is tight; or see Apollo as additive.

**Acknowledge**: "Budget is always a consideration."

**Respond**: "Apollo often replaces or consolidates. If you’re paying for a separate visitor ID, form enrichment, or routing tool, Apollo Inbound can cover that and use the same data as sales—one contract. For teams that also run outbound, one Apollo plan covers data, inbound, and outbound, so you’re not adding a net new tool. There’s a free tier and trial so you can prove conversion and speed-to-lead before committing."

**Proof Point**:
- One platform for inbound + outbound + data; consolidation savings
- Free tier; trial (pricing FAQ)
- Emerge Market: CMO tripled Apollo spend for 400% pipeline growth (inbound + outbound)

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are you spending today on lead routing, form tools, or visitor ID? We can map that to one Apollo plan."

---

### 3. Timing: "We're not looking to change inbound until next year"

**Why They Say This**: No urgency; other priorities; or contract lock-in.

**Acknowledge**: "Timing has to work for you."

**Respond**: "No need to change everything now. You can start with visitor ID or form enrichment in a single campaign or region—free tier or trial—and measure conversion and time-to-first-touch. When you’re ready to standardize or renew other tools, you’ll have data. The cost of waiting is another year of slow follow-up or disconnected data between marketing and sales if that’s a pain today."

**Proof Point**:
- Free tier and trial = low risk
- 300% routing improvement; "don’t let hot leads go cold"

**Follow-Up Question**: "When do your current routing or form tools come up for renewal? We can align a pilot to that."

---

### 4. Competition: "We use HubSpot / Marketo for forms and routing"

**Why They Say This**: CRM or MAP is the center of their stack; integration expectation.

**Acknowledge**: "HubSpot and Marketo are core to a lot of teams. Integration matters."

**Respond**: "Apollo integrates with HubSpot and Marketo—we sync data and activity so your CRM stays the source of record. The difference is we add a single B2B data layer: 210M contacts, real-time form enrichment, and instant routing so leads are enriched and routed in seconds, not hours. Same data powers outbound so sales and marketing share one source. If you’re seeing slow follow-up or thin lead data, Apollo can sit alongside or replace point solutions for enrichment and routing."

**Proof Point**:
- Integrations: HubSpot, Marketo (products, company)
- Form enrichment; 65+ data points; same data for sales
- 300% routing accuracy; Emerge Market 400% pipeline

**Follow-Up Question**: "Is your main issue speed of follow-up, quality of lead data, or both?"

---

### 5. Status Quo: "Our conversion is fine"

**Why They Say This**: Don’t see a problem; or haven’t measured speed and routing.

**Acknowledge**: "If conversion is where you want it, that’s great."

**Respond**: "Many teams don’t measure time-to-first-touch or routing accuracy until they try something faster. Apollo gives you visitor ID, form enrichment from just an email, and instant routing—so hot leads don’t wait. We’ve seen 300% routing accuracy improvement and higher conversion. There’s a free tier so you can run a test on one segment or campaign and see if conversion and speed improve. No commitment."

**Proof Point**:
- 300% routing accuracy (Apollo)
- "Don’t let hot leads go cold"; instant routing + scheduler
- Free tier for testing

**Follow-Up Question**: "What’s your average time from form submit to first rep touch? Even a rough number helps."

---

### 6. Authority: "I need to align with sales / RevOps on this"

**Why They Say This**: Real need for alignment; marketing doesn’t own tool alone.

**Acknowledge**: "Sales and RevOps need to be on board, especially for routing and data."

**Respond**: "Apollo actually helps alignment: marketing and sales use the same data (Apollo Data) for inbound and outbound, so there’s one source of truth. RevOps likes one integration and one contract. We can do a joint call with sales and RevOps and show how inbound routing, form enrichment, and outbound all run on the same platform. We have one-pagers and customer stories—Emerge Market’s CMO drove 400% pipeline growth with Apollo across inbound and outbound."

**Proof Point**:
- One data layer for marketing and sales; RevOps consolidation (Census, etc.)
- Emerge Market: CMO, 400% pipeline
- Integrations and one platform

**Follow-Up Question**: "Who would need to be in the room—sales lead, RevOps, or both—and what would they need to see?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "When a high-intent lead submits a form, how long until the right rep touches them?"
2. "Do you use a separate tool for visitor ID or form enrichment, and where does that data live vs. sales?"
3. "Who owns lead routing and enrichment—marketing, sales, or RevOps?"
4. "Are you looking to add a tool or consolidate and improve speed/conversion?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "Sales owns routing, we just generate leads" (position shared data and speed; involve sales)
- "We’re all-in on HubSpot" (position Apollo as enrichment + routing that syncs to HubSpot)
- "We don’t have budget for marketing tools" (position consolidation and shared platform with sales)

## Quick Reference

| Objection Type | Key Response | Proof Point |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Routing / incumbent | One platform + same data as sales; 300% routing improvement | Inbound; 300% case |
| Price | Consolidation; one plan for inbound + data; free tier | Emerge Market; free tier |
| Timing | Pilot or free tier; measure conversion and speed | Trial; renewal alignment |
| Competition (HubSpot/Marketo) | Integrates; add data + speed; same source for sales | Integrations; 300% routing |
| Status Quo | Measure time-to-touch; free test | 300% routing; free tier |
| Authority | Same data for sales/RevOps; joint call; one-pager | Emerge Market; integrations |
