# SDR/BDR - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from SDRs and BDRs (and managers speaking for them) and how to handle them with Apollo-specific proof and follow-ups. Note: SDRs/BDRs often don’t buy alone; these objections may come from them in pilots or from their managers.

## Objections

### 1. Workflow: "We're used to our current tools / don't want to learn something new"

**Why They Say This**: Change fatigue; fear of lower productivity during switch; or comfort with current workflow.

**Acknowledge**: "Switching tools can feel like a burden, especially when you’re focused on hitting number."

**Respond**: "Apollo is built so reps spend less time in tools and more time selling. One place for data, sequences, and dialer—no switching tabs. You get a prioritized task list so you know what to do next, and AI that builds lists and campaigns so you’re not doing manual research. Customers say reps are 50% less manual work and book 75% more meetings. There’s a free tier so you can try it with no commitment and see if it’s actually easier."

**Proof Point**:
- Cyera: "Every rep is more productive"; 75% more meetings, 50% less manual work
- One platform; prioritized tasks; AI Assistant (product pages)
- Free tier to try

**Follow-Up Question**: "Would you be open to a 2-week trial with your team and compare meetings and time spent in tools?"

---

### 2. Price/Budget: "Our company won't pay for another tool"

**Why They Say This**: Thinks Apollo is additive; doesn’t know about consolidation.

**Acknowledge**: "No one wants to add more cost."

**Respond**: "Apollo usually replaces other tools, so total cost goes down. Teams run ZoomInfo and Outreach—that’s two contracts. Apollo is both in one, and customers save 50% or more. There’s also a free Starter plan forever and a trial, so your company can prove ROI before paying. Reps get one tool instead of two or three, and the company often pays less."

**Proof Point**:
- 50% savings (Predictable Revenue); 64% lower tech stack (Census)
- Free Starter; trial with 50 credits (pricing FAQ)

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do you know what you’re spending today on data and outreach? We can show the comparison."

---

### 3. Timing: "We're in the middle of a push / can't switch now"

**Why They Say This**: Quarter or campaign focus; fear of disruption.

**Acknowledge**: "You can’t afford to miss your number. No one wants a disruption mid-push."

**Respond**: "You don’t have to switch everything at once. Start with a pilot—free tier or trial—and run it alongside what you have. Reps often see more meetings and less admin within a few weeks. When things calm down or at renewal, you can move fully. Waiting usually means another quarter of juggling tools and manual work."

**Proof Point**:
- Cyera, GTM Ops results in short timeframes
- Free tier = no contract; try without switching

**Follow-Up Question**: "Would a 2-week pilot with one pod work—no switch, just compare output?"

---

### 4. Competition: "We use Outreach / Salesloft and it works"

**Why They Say This**: Satisfied with sequences; may not own data vendor relationship.

**Acknowledge**: "Outreach and Salesloft are solid. The question is whether you need a separate data tool too."

**Respond**: "If you’re on Outreach or Salesloft, you’re probably also paying for ZoomInfo or another data provider—two tools, two logins. Apollo has 210M contacts and sequences and dialer in one. So you’re in one place, and the company often cuts cost 50%. Reps get a prioritized task list and AI that builds campaigns so you spend less time researching. Customers who switched say 75% more meetings and 50% less manual work."

**Proof Point**:
- One platform vs. Outreach + ZoomInfo; 50% savings
- Cyera: 75% more meetings, 50% less manual work; GTM Ops: 4x per SDR

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do you also use a separate tool for contact data? If so, would one tool for both be easier?"

---

### 5. Status Quo: "Our manager is happy with our current setup"

**Why They Say This**: Manager hasn’t pushed for change; or rep doesn’t want to rock the boat.

**Acknowledge**: "If the team is hitting number, that’s what matters."

**Respond**: "A lot of managers don’t realize how much time reps lose switching tools or how much the company spends on two contracts until they see the comparison. Apollo gives one platform and often 50% cost savings—and reps get 75% more meetings and 50% less manual work in the same day. Nothing has to change today: there’s a free tier. You or your manager could run a small pilot and see the difference before any decision."

**Proof Point**:
- Predictable Revenue, Census: managers/RevOps drove consolidation; 50% savings
- Cyera, GTM Ops: managers saw 75% more meetings, 4x SDR efficiency

**Follow-Up Question**: "Would your manager be open to seeing a quick comparison of current stack vs. one Apollo plan?"

---

### 6. Authority: "I'm not the decision-maker"

**Why They Say This**: True; SDRs/BDRs often don’t buy; or deflecting.

**Acknowledge**: "Makes sense. Who usually drives tool decisions—your manager, RevOps?"

**Respond**: "We can help whoever that is. We have ROI and consolidation one-pagers and customer references. If you’re seeing pain—too many tools, too much manual work—you can share that with your manager or RevOps and we can send them the comparison. Or we can talk to them directly. Either way, the story is simple: one platform, 50% less manual work, 75% more meetings, and often half the cost."

**Proof Point**:
- References: Cyera, GTM Ops, Predictable Revenue, Census
- One-pagers and ROI (value props, use cases)

**Follow-Up Question**: "Who would need to be in the room to evaluate a change—your manager, RevOps, or both?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "How many tools do you use in a typical day to prospect and log activity?"
2. "How much time do you spend on list-building and research vs. calling and emailing?"
3. "Is your team open to trying a new tool if it meant one place to work and less admin?"
4. "Who decides when you change or add sales tools?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We just got trained on Outreach" (don’t attack; position one platform and time saved)
- "I don’t have time to learn something new" (emphasize less manual work, prioritized list, one tool)
- "Only our RevOps talks to vendors" (offer to include RevOps; give rep one-pager to pass along)
