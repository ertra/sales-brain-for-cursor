# Common Objections (All Personas)

## Overview
Cross-persona objections and responses for Apollo, with proof points and follow-up questions. Use alongside persona-specific objection files (sales-leader, marketer, sdr-bdr, revenue-operations).

## Objections

### 1. Data / Quality: "We need enterprise-grade data like ZoomInfo"

**Why They Say This**: Trust in incumbent or procurement preference; concern about coverage and accuracy.

**Acknowledge**: "ZoomInfo is a known name. Data quality and coverage are critical."

**Respond**: "Apollo has 210M+ contacts and 30M+ companies with 91% email accuracy and real-time verification. Customers who compared them head-to-head chose Apollo for enrichment quality and cost. Census benchmarked ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless and said Apollo won on all fronts, especially enrichment—higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit, and they cut costs in half. We’re also GDPR compliant and used by Fortune 500 companies."

**Proof Point**:
- Census: "Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit. And we cut our costs in half."
- 91% email accuracy; 72M emails verified monthly; 65+ data points

**Follow-Up Question**: "Have you run a data quality or enrichment benchmark recently? Many teams see 50%+ improvement and lower cost when they compare."

---

### 2. Price/Budget: "We don't have the budget" / "Apollo is too expensive"

**Why They Say This**: Value not clear; comparing to free tools; or real budget constraint.

**Acknowledge**: "Budget is always a consideration."

**Respond**: "Apollo often reduces total spend because we replace multiple tools. Customers like Predictable Revenue cut cost 50% by replacing three tools with Apollo; Census saw 64% lower tech stack costs. There’s a free Starter plan forever and trials so you can prove ROI before committing. For teams currently on ZoomInfo + Outreach, we’re usually half the combined cost for data plus sequences plus dialer in one platform."

**Proof Point**:
- 50% cost savings (Predictable Revenue); 64% lower tech stack (Census)
- Free Starter plan; trial with 50 credits; cancel/upgrade/downgrade anytime (pricing FAQ)

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are you spending today on data, outreach, and dialer combined? We can map that to one Apollo plan."

---

### 3. Timing: "Not the right time" / "Let's revisit next quarter"

**Why They Say This**: Other priorities; contract not up for renewal; or avoiding decision.

**Acknowledge**: "Timing is important."

**Respond**: "Every quarter without consolidation is another quarter of double spend and reps switching between tools. Customers who moved to Apollo often wish they’d done it at renewal time. You can start free or on a trial—no need to wait for budget approval. If your ZoomInfo or Outreach renewal is coming up, that’s the ideal moment to compare one platform and lock in savings."

**Proof Point**:
- Payback often in first quarter from consolidation (value props)
- Trial and free plan reduce risk of "wrong time"

**Follow-Up Question**: "When does your current data or outreach contract renew? We can align a pilot to that."

---

### 4. Competition: "We're looking at ZoomInfo / Outreach / Salesloft"

**Why They Say This**: Doing due diligence; existing relationship; or procurement list.

**Acknowledge**: "Those are strong options. It’s smart to compare."

**Respond**: "ZoomInfo and Outreach are often used together—that’s two contracts and two integrations. Apollo is data and engagement in one: 210M contacts, sequences, and dialer. Customers like Census and Predictable Revenue replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach with Apollo and got better or equal outcomes at 50%+ savings. If you’re looking at Outreach or Salesloft alone, ask where your contact data will come from—with Apollo it’s included."

**Proof Point**:
- Census: replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach; 50% data quality increase, half the cost
- Predictable Revenue: 50% savings, three tools into one; 75% more meetings, speed to booking cut in half

**Follow-Up Question**: "Are you evaluating data and sequences as one purchase or two? That changes the comparison."

---

### 5. Status Quo: "We're fine with what we have"

**Why They Say This**: Change aversion; don’t see the problem; or comfortable with current stack.

**Acknowledge**: "If it’s working, that makes sense."

**Respond**: "Many teams don’t realize how much they’re spending or how much time reps lose switching tools until they see one platform. We hear: 50% less manual work, 75% more meetings, 4x SDR efficiency—all from consolidating and giving reps one place to work. There’s no obligation: free tier and trial let you test with your team. If you’re open to it, we can run a quick comparison of your current stack cost vs. one Apollo plan."

**Proof Point**:
- Cyera: 75% more meetings, 50% less manual work
- GTM Ops: 4x meetings with one SDR
- "Why buy five tools when one does it better?"

**Follow-Up Question**: "How much time do your reps spend each week switching between data, sequences, and dialer? Even a rough number helps."

---

### 6. Authority: "I need to check with my boss / RevOps / procurement"

**Why They Say This**: Real need for buy-in; or delay.

**Acknowledge**: "Getting the right people aligned is important."

**Respond**: "We can help. We have ROI and consolidation one-pagers, and customers like Census and Predictable Revenue are happy to reference. For procurement, we have SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001; we work with Fortune 500 and offer Custom plans. I can send a short summary and a comparison of your current stack cost vs. Apollo so your boss or RevOps has the numbers."

**Proof Point**:
- Enterprise: Ernst & Young, Oracle, Lyft (pricing FAQ); Custom plans for security and integrations
- Compliance: GDPR, SOC 2, CCPA, ISO 27001, etc. (company.md)

**Follow-Up Question**: "Who else is involved in the decision, and what would they need to see to get comfortable?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "What are you spending today on data, outreach, and dialer—and when do those contracts renew?"
2. "How much time do reps spend on research and admin vs. actually talking to prospects?"
3. "Who’s involved in choosing or renewing sales tech—just you, or RevOps, finance, procurement?"
4. "Are you looking to add a tool or replace/consolidate?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We’re locked in with ZoomInfo for another 2 years" (timing objection)
- "We only need sequences, we’re happy with our data" (may still be paying for both; consolidation angle)
- "We need to see a formal RFP response" (authority/process; offer ROI doc and security/compliance info)
