# Apollo Sales Brain

Human-friendly overview of the Apollo sales intelligence in this folder. For AI agents and file-level loading rules, see **INDEX.md**.

## What Is This?

This is a **Sales Brain** for **Apollo** (Apollo.io)—a structured set of markdown files that capture company info, products, personas, pain points, value propositions, use cases, competitors, objections, case studies, and sales plays. Use it for enablement, competitive prep, and consistent messaging.

## Apollo in One Sentence

Apollo is the **AI sales platform** that combines 210M+ B2B contacts (91% email accuracy), outbound (sequences, dialer, AI campaigns), inbound (visitor ID, form enrichment, routing), and deal execution (call insights, pipeline) in **one platform**—so teams book more meetings, cut manual work, and replace ZoomInfo + Outreach with one vendor at **50%+ cost savings**.

## Proof Points to Remember

| Customer | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Predictable Revenue** | **50%** cost savings; **2x** open rate; **50%** faster time to meeting; ZoomInfo + Outreach → Apollo |
| **Census** | **50%** data quality increase; **64%** cost savings; replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach; benchmark winner vs. ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, Seamless |
| **Cyera** | **75%** more meetings; **50%** less manual work; **4+** hours saved daily across team; 100+ reps |
| **GTM Ops** | **4x** meetings per SDR (one SDR = three previously) |
| **Built In** | **100k** leads enriched daily; "we don't have to touch it" |
| **Neurofit** | **39%** open rate with AI; **100+** hours manual research saved across 3 BDRs |

## Key Differentiators

1. **One platform** — Data (210M+ contacts), outbound, inbound, and deal execution in one contract; "why buy five tools when one does it better?"
2. **Replace ZoomInfo + Outreach** — Census and Predictable Revenue replaced both and cut cost 50%+ with same or better outcomes; Apollo wins on enrichment quality in benchmarks.
3. **75% more meetings, 50% less manual work** — Cyera; 4x SDR efficiency (GTM Ops); AI builds lists and campaigns, prioritized task list, built-in dialer and deliverability.
4. **Free tier and trial** — Start without budget approval; prove ROI before full rollout.
