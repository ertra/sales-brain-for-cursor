# Outbound

## Company
Apollo

## Overview
Apollo’s outbound sales software helps GTM teams book more meetings with less manual work. It combines Apollo Data, AI-built lists and campaigns, multichannel sequences, built-in deliverability, and task prioritization so reps focus on high-value conversations.

## Main Features
- **Launch**: AI Assistant to build lists and campaigns from natural language; real-time data and signals to find ideal leads; full-funnel multichannel campaigns in minutes; built-in deliverability tools
- **Execute**: Prioritized task lists; call scripts; built-in parallel dialer; Chrome extension to work in any tool; AI-powered meeting insights and follow-ups
- **Improve**: Analytics and dashboards; call insights for coaching; workflow automation to repeat winning plays; personalized onboarding

## Problem Solved
Manual prospecting and tool sprawl slow pipeline. Teams waste time on research, low-quality leads, and juggling data, outreach, and dialer tools. Outbound turns hours of prospecting into minutes and consolidates stack.

## Value Proposition
"Book more meetings, without all the grind." Proof points: Predictable Revenue 50% cost savings; Neurofit 39% open rate with AI; GTM Ops 4x meetings with one SDR; Cyera 75% more meetings booked and doubled call conversations.

## Target Customers
Sales leaders, BDRs, SDRs; teams that want to scale outbound without adding headcount or multiple vendors.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Outreach / SalesLoft | Apollo combines data + sequences + dialer + enrichment in one platform; often cited for cost savings and higher reply/open rates |
| ZoomInfo + Outreach | Apollo positions as single replacement with lower cost and simpler workflow |

## Pricing Model
Free tier; paid plans by seat. Trial available. See https://www.apollo.io/pricing

## Additional Notes
- "Meetings that practically book themselves — without all the extra cost, time, and apps." Replaces data provider, outreach platform, and dialer in one.
