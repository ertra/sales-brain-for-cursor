# Inbound

## Company
Apollo

## Overview
Apollo’s inbound solution helps B2B teams convert website and form leads into pipeline. It identifies anonymous visitors, enriches leads in real time, routes and schedules instantly, and automates nurture so hot leads don’t go cold.

## Main Features
- **Identify**: Website visitor tracking for anonymous companies; AI Research to surface decision-makers before form submit
- **Capture**: Form enrichment (auto-fill from email, shorten forms); Apollo Data for 65+ data points, qualification, scoring; form builder (coming soon)
- **Automate & improve**: Inbound router to qualify and route to the right rep; meetings scheduler; AI Assistant to build inbound workflows; analytics for conversion and optimization

## Problem Solved
Manual lead sorting and slow follow-up cause hot inbound leads to go cold. Teams lose conversion when forms are long, routing is manual, and follow-up is delayed.

## Value Proposition
"Convert inbound leads into B2B pipeline." Turn manual sorting and missed follow-ups into more meetings and faster conversion; route leads instantly to the right rep and reduce time-to-meeting.

## Target Customers
B2B sales and marketing teams with meaningful inbound traffic; teams that need lead routing, enrichment, and scheduling without adding more tools.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Standalone lead routing / form tools | Apollo combines visitor ID, enrichment, routing, scheduling, and sequences with one data source and one platform |

## Pricing Model
Free tier; paid plans. See https://www.apollo.io/pricing
