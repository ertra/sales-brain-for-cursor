# Data Enrichment

## Company
Apollo

## Overview
Apollo’s B2B data enrichment solution keeps records accurate and actionable across systems. Teams enrich with Apollo Data (210M+ contacts, 65+ data points), waterfall and AI Research, then cleanse and sync to CRM and other tools so outreach and routing never miss a beat.

## Main Features
- **Enrich**: Apollo Data for 210M+ contacts and 65+ data points; waterfall enrichment in a single workflow; AI Agents to research and add custom fields
- **Qualify**: AI Research for custom insights and intent; real-time buyer intent; AI-powered or custom lead scoring
- **Cleanse**: CRM updates on demand, scheduled, or real-time; CSV import/export; API and integrations to push/pull data across the stack

## Problem Solved
Outdated or incomplete data leads to wrong targeting, wasted touches, and poor routing. Enrichment is often siloed or requires multiple vendors. Apollo delivers always-on, accurate data into the systems teams already use.

## Value Proposition
"Fuel smarter selling with B2B data enrichment." Proof points: Leadium 3x annual revenue with Apollo’s open API; Census 50% increased data quality and replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach; Built In 100k leads enriched daily with minimal manual work.

## Target Customers
Revenue ops, sales ops, marketing ops; teams that need enrichment for routing, personalization, and CRM hygiene without managing multiple data vendors.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| ZoomInfo / Clearbit | Apollo positions higher enrichment quality and breadth, single platform with engagement, lower cost |
| Lusha / Seamless | Apollo offers full database + enrichment + workflows in one place |

## Additional Notes
- "Reach the right people, faster, with data you can rely on." Enrichment feeds directly into outbound, inbound, and deal execution in the same platform.
