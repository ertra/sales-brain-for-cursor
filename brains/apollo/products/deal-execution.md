# Deal Execution

## Company
Apollo

## Overview
Apollo’s sales execution software helps teams move deals from first call to close with less admin. It provides pre-meeting insights, call recording and AI summaries, automated follow-up and CRM updates, pipeline boards, and conversation analytics—all in one place.

## Main Features
- **Prep**: Custom instant booking links; pre-meeting insights (company intel, decision-makers) so every meeting starts strong
- **Progress**: Call recording and key insights; automatic task creation; AI-personalized follow-up emails; automatic CRM updates with activity and call insights
- **Manage**: Deal, activity, and contact data in one place; pipeline boards and real-time deal alerts; conversation insights and performance dashboards for coaching

## Problem Solved
Reps spend too much time on prep, notes, and CRM updates instead of selling. Deals slip when follow-up is manual and pipeline visibility is scattered across tools. Apollo automates the grind so reps focus on relationships.

## Value Proposition
"Sales execution software that keeps deals moving." Proof points: Cyera 50% less manual work, 75% more meetings; FLO EV $2.3M revenue sourced through Apollo; Bitrise consolidated tools (e.g. replaced Chili Piper with Apollo Meetings); Plative/TopOut faster prep and automatic Apollo–HubSpot sync.

## Target Customers
Sales leaders, AEs, BDRs closing enterprise and mid-market deals; teams that want one place for meetings, calls, pipeline, and coaching.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Gong / Chorus | Apollo bundles deal execution with data, sequences, and CRM in one platform; single vendor for pipeline and conversation intelligence |
| Chili Piper / Calendly | Apollo includes scheduling and meeting features as part of platform; often cited as consolidation play |

## Pricing Model
Included in Apollo platform plans; see https://www.apollo.io/pricing

## Additional Notes
- "Let AI take care of the grind. You take care of the relationships." Integrates with HubSpot, Salesforce, and other CRMs for automatic sync.
