# Sales Play: Scale Outbound Without Adding Headcount

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Scale Outbound Without Adding Headcount |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Leader (VP Sales, BDR Leader, Director of Business Development) |
| **Target Company** | B2B; outbound motion; pipeline-constrained; headcount freeze or need to prove productivity before hiring |
| **Products** | Apollo Outbound, Apollo Data; optional Deal Execution |
| **Trigger Event** | Headcount freeze; "we need more meetings"; rep productivity concern; tool sprawl |
| **Play Type** | Outbound / Productivity |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Pipeline target increased but no new SDR/BDR headcount approved
- Sales leader wants to "do more with same team" or prove 4x efficiency before hiring
- Reps buried in manual research and list-building; low meeting volume per rep
- Evaluation of new "sales engagement" or "sales intelligence" tool

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Job posts for BDR/SDR or "sales development"; growth stage
- Using multiple tools (data + sequences + dialer); rep productivity mentioned in earnings or all-hands
- Recently missed pipeline; board or CFO pushing efficiency

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | 3–50+ SDRs/BDRs; or 1–20 sales/marketing users |
| Industry | B2B; outbound is primary or significant motion |
| Tech Stack | Any; often ZoomInfo + Outreach or point solutions; CRM |
| Budget | Open to tool investment that reduces cost or increases output |

## The Play

### Objective
Win as the single platform that multiplies per-rep output: 75% more meetings, 4x SDR efficiency, 50% less manual work—so the leader hits pipeline without adding headcount.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Book more meetings without the grind. GTM Ops gets as many ICP meetings with one SDR as they had with three. Cyera booked 75% more meetings while cutting manual work in half. One platform for data, sequences, and dialer—prioritized task list so reps focus on conversations, not research."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 15 minutes

- [ ] Identify sales leader or BDR manager; confirm team size and meeting targets
- [ ] Note if they use ZoomInfo, Outreach, SalesLoft, or patchwork of tools
- [ ] Find trigger: headcount freeze, pipeline miss, or "productivity" initiative
- [ ] Prepare Cyera and GTM Ops metrics (75% more meetings, 4x SDR, 50% less manual work)

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Tuesday–Thursday

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: 75% more meetings without adding headcount

Hi {First Name},

Most BDR teams are capped by manual research and tool sprawl—not by talent.

Cyera booked 75% more meetings and cut manual work in half with one platform. GTM Ops gets 4x the meetings per SDR (one SDR doing the work of three).

If you're trying to hit a higher pipeline number without adding heads, worth a quick look at how they did it.

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How many meetings do you need per month to hit pipeline, and how many SDRs do you have today?
2. If you couldn't add headcount next quarter, could your current team 2x meeting volume with the right tools?
3. How much time do reps spend on list-building and research vs. actually calling and emailing?
4. How many tools do they use in a typical day (data, sequences, dialer, CRM)?

**Key Points to Cover**:
- 4x SDR efficiency (GTM Ops); 75% more meetings, 50% less manual work (Cyera)
- One platform: data + sequences + dialer + prioritized task list
- AI builds lists and campaigns so reps spend time on conversations

### Step 4: Demo
**Demo Flow**: AI Assistant building a list and campaign → Prioritized task list → Sequences and dialer in same platform → Analytics/call insights. Emphasize "one place to work" and "50% less manual work."

### Step 5: Proposal & Close
**Proposal Elements**: Pilot with one pod (free tier or trial); compare meetings and hours saved before/after; then team rollout. ROI: meetings per rep, cost per meeting, stack cost vs. current.
**Negotiation Levers**: Pilot first; include Deal Execution if they care about call insights and pipeline visibility.

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We need more SDRs, not a new tool" | "GTM Ops gets 4x the meetings with one SDR as with three. Cyera got 75% more meetings with the same team. Often the constraint is tools and process—we can run a pilot and measure before you add headcount." |
| "We're not looking to switch tools right now" | "No switch required to start—free tier or trial. Compare meetings and time saved in 2–3 weeks. If the numbers move, then we talk rollout." |
| "I need to get RevOps on board" | "We can join a call with RevOps. One platform usually means less for them to integrate and maintain—and 50% cost savings when replacing multiple tools." |
