# Sales Play: Data Quality & RevOps Consolidation

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Data Quality & RevOps Consolidation |
| **Target Persona** | Revenue Operations (RevOps, Sales Ops, GTM Ops) |
| **Target Company** | B2B; mid-market to enterprise; dedicated RevOps; data quality or enrichment initiative |
| **Products** | Apollo Data, Data Enrichment; full platform if replacing engagement too |
| **Trigger Event** | ZoomInfo/Clearbit/enrichment renewal; "data quality" initiative; new RevOps hire; CRM migration |
| **Play Type** | Outbound / Competitive (data vendors) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- ZoomInfo, Clearbit, or enrichment vendor contract renewal (3–6 months out)
- New RevOps or Sales Ops lead with "fix data" or "single source of truth" mandate
- CRM migration or consolidation project
- Leadership push to reduce vendor count and cost
- Complaints about stale data, routing accuracy, or "reps don't trust the CRM"

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Job posts for RevOps, Sales Ops; "data quality," "enrichment," "single source of truth"
- Tech stack includes ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, or multiple enrichment tools
- Recent data or CRM initiative; G2/reviews mentioning data accuracy

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | 50–500+ employees; dedicated RevOps or Sales Ops |
| Industry | B2B; SaaS, tech, high-velocity sales common |
| Tech Stack | ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, or point enrichment; CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot); possibly Outreach/SalesLoft |
| Budget | Spending on data/enrichment (often $15K–$80K+); open to consolidation |

## The Play

### Objective
Win as the single B2B data source for GTM: 50%+ data quality improvement, replace ZoomInfo/Clearbit with one platform, cut cost in half. Optional: replace engagement too (Outreach/SalesLoft) for 64% lower tech stack (Census).

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Census benchmarked ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless—Apollo won on all fronts, especially enrichment. Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit. They cut cost in half and got 50% data quality increase. Built In enriches 100k leads daily and says they don't have to touch it. One platform for data and enrichment—and if you're also on Outreach, one contract for data + engagement."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 15–20 minutes

- [ ] Identify RevOps or Sales Ops lead; confirm data/enrichment vendors and renewal dates
- [ ] Note CRM and downstream tools (routing, scoring, sequences)
- [ ] Find trigger: renewal, data quality project, or consolidation mandate
- [ ] Prepare Census and Built In one-liners; 91% email accuracy, 210M contacts

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Tuesday–Thursday

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: 50% better data quality, half the cost (how Census did it)

Hi {First Name},

Census benchmarked ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless for their renewal. Apollo won on enrichment quality and breadth—and they cut their costs in half.

50% data quality increase, 64% lower tech stack. One platform for data (and they replaced Outreach too).

If your ZoomInfo or enrichment renewal is coming up, worth a 15-min comparison.

{Calendar link} or reply with a time.

```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How many data and enrichment vendors do you use today, and what's the combined cost?
2. When do those contracts renew?
3. Where do reps or leaders say the data is wrong—coverage, freshness, or too many sources?
4. How do you keep CRM in sync with enrichment—manual, batch, or real-time?
5. Would you consider replacing ZoomInfo and Outreach (or SalesLoft) with one platform if it improved quality and cut cost 50%+?

**Key Points to Cover**:
- Census: benchmark winner; 50% data quality, half the cost; migration "matter of weeks"
- Built In: 100k leads enriched daily; "we don't have to touch it"
- One source of truth; 91% email accuracy; real-time or scheduled CRM sync

### Step 4: Demo
**Demo Flow**: Apollo Data (coverage, 65+ data points, 91% accuracy) → Enrichment and waterfall → CRM/API sync (on demand, scheduled, real-time) → Optional: show Outbound if replacing engagement too.

### Step 5: Proposal & Close
**Proposal Elements**: Current vendor cost vs. Apollo; data quality and coverage comparison; migration timeline; references (Census, Built In). If replacing engagement: full platform ROI (64% lower stack).
**Negotiation Levers**: Pilot on one use case (e.g. enrichment only); multi-year; include API/Custom for enterprise.

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We've standardized on ZoomInfo" | "Census had too—they ran a benchmark at renewal and Apollo won on enrichment quality. They cut cost in half. Happy to share the story and a comparison template." |
| "We need to run an RFP" | "Include Apollo in the RFP. We can provide security docs, compliance, and a reference call with Census or Built In." |
| "Our integrations are built around our current stack" | "Apollo syncs with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft—one integration often replaces two. We can map your current flow to Apollo." |
