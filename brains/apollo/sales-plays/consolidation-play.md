- Recently missed pipeline or forecast; cost-cutting initiative

| Budget | Currently spending $20K–$100K+ on data + engagement combined |

## The Play

### Objective
Replace ZoomInfo and Outreach (or SalesLoft) with Apollo in one contract; deliver 50%+ cost savings and same or better meeting volume, reply rates, and data quality.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"One platform for data, sequences, and dialer—replace two contracts and cut cost in half. Census replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach with Apollo and got 50% better data quality and 64% cost savings. Predictable Revenue saved 50% and got 2x open rate and 50% faster time to meeting."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 15–20 minutes

- [ ] Confirm current stack (ZoomInfo? Outreach? SalesLoft?); estimate combined annual spend
- [ ] Note renewal dates for data and engagement contracts
- [ ] Identify champion (Sales Leader, RevOps); any recent "consolidate tools" or cost initiative
- [ ] Prepare Census and Predictable Revenue one-liners and case study links

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Tuesday–Thursday; avoid Monday a.m. and Friday p.m.

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: 50% less on ZoomInfo + Outreach—one platform

Hi {First Name},

Most teams running ZoomInfo and Outreach are spending 2x what they need for data and sequences in one place.

Census replaced both with Apollo and cut cost 64% while improving data quality 50%. Predictable Revenue saved 50% and doubled open rates and cut time-to-meeting in half.

If your ZoomInfo or Outreach renewal is coming up, worth a 15-min comparison—one contract, one integration.

{Calendar link} or reply with a time that works.

```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Discovery Questions**:
1. What are you spending today on ZoomInfo (or similar) and Outreach/SalesLoft combined?
2. When do those contracts renew?
3. How much time do reps spend switching between data and sequences—and who owns keeping the CRM in sync?
4. Would consolidating to one platform be a priority if it cut cost 50% and kept or improved meetings?

**Key Points to Cover**:
- One platform = one contract, one integration; 50%+ savings (Census, Predictable Revenue)
- Data quality: Census benchmarked ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, Seamless—Apollo won on enrichment
- Migration: "matter of weeks" (Census); no long project

### Step 4: Demo
**Demo Flow**: Apollo Data (search, lists, enrichment) → Outbound (sequences, tasks, dialer) → CRM sync; compare to "today: ZoomInfo + Outreach" and show one login, one pipeline view.

### Step 5: Proposal & Close
**Proposal Elements**: Current stack cost comparison; Apollo plan (data + engagement); migration timeline (weeks); references (Census, Predictable Revenue).
**Negotiation Levers**: Multi-year discount; pilot then full rollout; include Deal Execution or Inbound if relevant.

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We're locked in with ZoomInfo for another year" | "When does that renewal come up? We can run a pilot now and align the switch to renewal so you don't double-pay." |
| "Our reps love Outreach" | "Apollo gives the same workflow—sequences, tasks, dialer—plus data in one place. Predictable Revenue and Census saw better open rates and faster time to meeting after switching." |
| "We need to run an RFP" | "Include Apollo in the RFP. We can provide ROI one-pager, security/compliance, and reference calls with Census or Predictable Revenue." |
