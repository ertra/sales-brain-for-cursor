# Marketer - Pain Points

## Overview
Marketers responsible for demand gen and inbound struggle with anonymous visitors, long forms that kill conversion, slow or manual lead routing, and hot leads going cold before sales acts. They often have disconnected tools for forms, enrichment, routing, and nurture, with no single view of inbound performance or shared data with sales.

## Pain Points

### 1. Hot leads go cold before sales acts
- **Description**: Inbound leads wait too long for first touch. Routing is manual or slow; by the time the right rep gets the lead, intent has cooled.
- **Impact**: Lower conversion; wasted spend; friction with sales; missed pipeline from inbound.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual assignment, SLAs that aren’t enforced, or adding more SDRs to react faster.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Inbound (inbound router, instant routing, meetings scheduler, AI workflows)
- **Key Message**: "Qualify and route every lead in seconds—don’t let hot leads go cold."

### 2. Anonymous visitors and long forms
- **Description**: Can’t identify companies visiting the site; forms are long and conversion suffers; no real-time enrichment so scoring and routing happen on thin data.
- **Impact**: Lost pipeline from anonymous traffic; lower form conversion; poor lead quality and routing.
- **Current Solutions**: Long forms, third-party visitor ID (often expensive), or manual research after submit.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Inbound (visitor tracking, form enrichment with Apollo Data); Apollo Data (65+ data points for scoring)
- **Key Message**: "See who’s visiting, shorten forms with real-time enrichment, and surface decision-makers before they submit."

### 3. Disconnected tools and no single view
- **Description**: Forms, enrichment, routing, and nurture live in different systems. No one view of inbound performance; marketing and sales don’t share the same data.
- **Impact**: Hard to optimize conversion and routing; duplicate vendors; alignment issues with sales.
- **Current Solutions**: Dashboards in multiple tools, spreadsheets, or accepting limited visibility.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: Inbound + Apollo Data (one platform for visitor ID, enrichment, routing, nurture); built-in analytics
- **Key Message**: "One platform for inbound—enrichment, routing, scheduling, and nurture with the same data sales uses."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Hot leads go cold | High | Daily | Inbound (router, scheduler) | Instant routing + scheduler; 300% routing accuracy improvement |
| Anonymous visitors / long forms | Medium–High | Daily | Inbound + Apollo Data | Visitor ID + form enrichment from one data source |
| Disconnected tools / no single view | Medium | Weekly | Inbound + Data | One platform; shared data with sales and outbound |

## Discovery Questions
1. When a high-intent lead comes in, how long until the right rep touches them?
2. How do you today identify anonymous visitors, and do you shorten forms with enrichment?
3. How many tools touch the journey from form submit to first meeting—and do marketing and sales share one source of truth?
4. What does conversion from visitor to meeting look like, and where do leads drop off?

## Trigger Events
- Inbound volume up but conversion or speed-to-lead is down
- Sales complaining about lead quality or slow handoffs
- New demand gen lead wants to improve conversion and routing
- Evaluating or replacing form/lead routing vendors
- Need to prove ROI on inbound and attribution to pipeline
