# SDR / BDR - Pain Points

## Overview
SDRs and BDRs are measured on meetings booked and activity. They struggle with hours of manual research and list-building, low response and connect rates, too many tools to juggle, deliverability issues, and unclear daily priorities. They want to hit targets without burnout and spend time on conversations, not admin.

## Pain Points

### 1. Hours on manual research and list-building
- **Description**: Building lists and researching prospects takes most of the day. Finding the right contacts and personalizing at scale feels impossible.
- **Impact**: Fewer calls and emails; lower quality outreach; missed targets; burnout.
- **Current Solutions**: Spreadsheets, multiple data tools, copying from LinkedIn, or skipping research and sending generic outreach.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Apollo Data (65+ data points, verified emails/phones); Outbound (AI Assistant to build lists and campaigns from natural language)
- **Key Message**: "Build lists and campaigns in minutes with AI—focus on selling, not research."

### 2. Too many tools and duplicate data entry
- **Description**: Switching between data provider, sequences, dialer, and CRM. Same info entered in multiple places; context-switching kills flow.
- **Impact**: Less time selling; errors and missed follow-ups; frustration; slow ramp for new reps.
- **Current Solutions**: Accept the chaos, use Chrome tabs, or beg for one integrated tool.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Full Apollo platform (data, email, dialer, pipeline in one); Chrome extension to work wherever they are
- **Key Message**: "One platform, one place—no more juggling five apps. 50% less manual work."

### 3. Deliverability issues and no clear priorities
- **Description**: Emails bounce or land in spam; hard to know which tasks to do first; follow-ups and next steps fall through the cracks.
- **Impact**: Low open/reply rates; missed meetings; inconsistent activity; managers can’t tell if it’s list quality or execution.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual deliverability checks, ad-hoc task lists, or hope for the best.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Outbound (built-in deliverability, prioritized task list, AI follow-ups); Deal Execution (pre-meeting insights, auto task creation)
- **Key Message**: "Start every day with a prioritized list. Built-in deliverability and AI so you never miss a follow-up."
