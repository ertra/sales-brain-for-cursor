# Use Case: Convert Inbound Leads Faster

## Overview
Marketing and sales teams lose pipeline when inbound leads wait too long for first touch or are routed and enriched with thin data. They use Apollo Inbound to identify anonymous visitors, enrich forms in real time, route and schedule instantly, and automate nurture—improving routing accuracy (e.g. 300%) and conversion so hot leads don’t go cold.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B with meaningful inbound (SaaS, tech, professional services)
- **Size**: SMB to mid-market; marketing and SDRs handle inbound
- **Characteristics**: Have forms and website traffic; want faster follow-up and better lead quality; may use separate visitor ID or routing tools

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Marketer (Demand Gen, Growth, Marketing Ops)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Leader, SDR/BDR (receivers of routed leads), RevOps (data and routing)

### Trigger Event
- Inbound volume up but conversion or speed-to-lead down; sales complains about lead quality or slow handoffs; evaluating form or routing vendors.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Anonymous visitors; long forms that hurt conversion; manual or slow routing
- Hot leads go cold before the right rep acts; enrichment happens in a different tool than sales uses
- Disconnected tools for forms, visitor ID, enrichment, routing, and nurture; no single view of inbound performance

### Desired State (After)
- Identify companies visiting the site; shorten forms with real-time enrichment (e.g. email → full profile)
- Route and schedule in seconds; automate qualification and nurture
- One platform and one data source (Apollo Data) for inbound and outbound; 300%+ routing accuracy improvement and higher conversion

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Inbound (visitor tracking, form enrichment, inbound router, meetings scheduler, AI workflows)
- **Supporting**: Apollo Data (65+ data points for scoring and routing)

### Solution Overview
Use visitor tracking to identify anonymous companies; use form enrichment so a single email (or minimal fields) triggers full enrichment and scoring. Route leads to the right rep with rules and round-robin; offer built-in scheduler for instant booking. Use AI Assistant to build inbound workflows. Same Apollo Data for outbound so marketing and sales share one source of truth.

### Implementation Steps
1. Add visitor tracking and form enrichment (e.g. embed or integrate with existing forms)
2. Define routing rules and assign reps; connect scheduler and calendar
3. Set up nurture and follow-up sequences for non-instant conversions
4. Monitor conversion, time-to-first-touch, and routing accuracy; optimize with analytics

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Routing accuracy | 300% improvement (Apollo case) |
| Inbound conversion | Higher with better routing and enrichment |
| Time to first touch | Seconds (instant routing + scheduler) |
| Form length / completion | Shorter forms via real-time enrichment |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Hot leads get immediate attention; “don’t let hot leads go cold”
- One platform for visitor ID, enrichment, routing, and nurture
- Same data as sales for consistency and reporting
