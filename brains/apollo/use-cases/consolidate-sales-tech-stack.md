# Use Case: Consolidate Sales Tech Stack and Reduce Cost

## Overview
Companies running multiple vendors for data (e.g. ZoomInfo), outreach (Outreach/SalesLoft), dialer, and enrichment want to cut cost and complexity by moving to one platform. Apollo replaces data provider, sequences, dialer, and enrichment in a single contract—delivering 50%+ cost savings while improving reply rates, meetings, and speed to booking.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; common in SaaS, tech, and high-velocity sales
- **Size**: SMB to mid-market; often 5–50+ sales/marketing users
- **Characteristics**: Currently use ZoomInfo and/or Outreach (or similar); feel cost and integration pain; open to consolidation

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader (budget owner), Revenue Operations (stack owner)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: SDR/BDR (users), Finance (approval)

### Trigger Event
- ZoomInfo, Outreach, or dialer renewal; new RevOps or sales leader pushing “fewer tools”; budget pressure to reduce sales tech spend.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Multiple contracts: data provider, outreach platform, dialer, sometimes enrichment
- High combined cost; multiple integrations to build and maintain
- Reps switch between tools; data and activity scattered; leaders lack one view
- Redundant capabilities and duplicate data entry

### Desired State (After)
- One platform for data, sequences, dialer, and enrichment; one contract and one integration
- 50%+ cost reduction while maintaining or improving meeting volume and reply rates
- Single place for pipeline and activity; faster ramp and adoption

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Full Apollo platform (Apollo Data + Outbound + optional Inbound + Deal Execution)
- **Supporting**: Data Enrichment (if replacing enrichment vendor); Deal Execution (if replacing call/scheduling tools)

### Solution Overview
Replace ZoomInfo (or similar) with Apollo Data for contacts and companies; replace Outreach/SalesLoft with Apollo sequences, tasks, and dialer; use Apollo for enrichment and CRM sync. One login, one data model, one integration to CRM. Custom plans and API for enterprise.

### Implementation Steps
1. Map current usage (credits, seats, features) to Apollo plans; run pilot with one team or segment
2. Migrate lists and sequences; connect CRM and email; train on prioritized tasks and workflows
3. Sunset legacy tools in phases; move remaining users to Apollo
4. Monitor meetings, reply rates, and cost; optimize usage and add-ons

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Tech stack cost | 50% savings (Predictable Revenue); 64% lower (Census) |
| Number of tools | 3+ → 1 (e.g. Predictable Revenue: “three tools into one”) |
| Reply/open rates | Higher (Predictable Revenue: “open rates are doubled”) |
| Speed to booking | Cut in half (Predictable Revenue) |

### Qualitative Benefits
- One vendor to manage; simpler procurement and renewals
- One integration and one source of truth for pipeline and activity
- Reps adopt faster with single platform; less context-switching

## Proof Points

### Customer Example
- **Company**: Predictable Revenue
- **Challenge**: Complexity and cost of running multiple sales tools
- **Solution**: Replaced three tools with Apollo (data, sequences, execution in one)
- **Results**: 50% cost savings; higher reply rates, open rates doubled, meetings up, speed to booking cut in half
- **Quote**: "We reduced the complexity of three tools into one. We're getting higher reply rates, open rates are doubled, meetings are up, and speed to booking a meeting is cut in half. This is the sales platform for people who want to do more with their outreach." — Collin Steward, CEO at Predictable Revenue

### Data Points
- Predictable Revenue: 50% cost savings; three tools into one
- Census: 64% lower tech stack costs; replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach
- “Why buy five tools when one does it better?” (Apollo positioning)

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How much do you spend today on ZoomInfo (or similar), Outreach/SalesLoft, dialer, and enrichment combined?
2. How many integrations do you maintain across those tools, and who owns them?
3. If you could cut that spend in half and keep or improve meeting volume, would that be a priority?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Apollo Data (search, lists, enrichment) replacing data provider
- Sequences, tasks, and dialer in same platform
- CRM sync and single activity timeline
- Pricing and packaging vs. current stack

### Key Talking Points
- “50% cost savings” (Predictable Revenue); “64% lower tech stack” (Census)
- “Three tools into one” without losing meetings or reply rates
- One contract, one integration, one place for pipeline
