# Use Case: Improve Data Quality and Enrichment at Scale

## Overview
Revenue and sales ops teams need accurate, complete B2B data for routing, scoring, and outreach but run into stale data, multiple enrichment vendors, and manual CRM hygiene. They use Apollo Data and Data Enrichment as the single source: 210M+ contacts, 91% email accuracy, waterfall enrichment, and real-time or scheduled CRM sync—achieving 50%+ data quality improvement and scaling to 100k+ leads enriched daily without proportional manual work.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS, tech, high-velocity sales; any company that relies on lead/account data for GTM
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; dedicated RevOps or sales ops
- **Characteristics**: Use or have evaluated ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha; care about coverage, accuracy, and CRM sync

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Operations (RevOps, Sales Ops, GTM Ops)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Leader, Marketer (consumers of enriched data)

### Trigger Event
- Enrichment or data contract renewal; “data quality” initiative; new RevOps hire; CRM migration or consolidation.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Stale or incomplete records; multiple data/enrichment vendors with different coverage and quality
- Routing and scoring based on thin or outdated data; reps don’t trust the CRM
- Manual cleanup or batch jobs; CRM and downstream tools out of sync
- High cost for data + enrichment + point solutions

### Desired State (After)
- One B2B data source with high accuracy (e.g. 91% email); 65+ data points for routing and personalization
- Enrichment at scale (e.g. 100k+ leads daily) with minimal manual touch; CRM updated on demand or in real time
- 50%+ improvement in data quality; replace ZoomInfo/Clearbit with one platform and cut cost

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Apollo Data, Data Enrichment (waterfall, AI Research, CRM/API sync)
- **Supporting**: Outbound/Inbound (same data for sequences and routing)

### Solution Overview
Use Apollo Data for contact and company coverage and verification; run waterfall enrichment and AI Research for hard-to-find fields. Sync to CRM and other systems on demand, on a schedule, or in real time via API and native integrations. One data layer for outbound, inbound, and enrichment so routing and scoring use the same source of truth.

### Implementation Steps
1. Audit current data sources and enrichment workflows; define “source of truth” and sync rules
2. Pilot Apollo Data and enrichment (e.g. one segment or use case); compare quality and coverage to incumbents
3. Roll out waterfall and AI Research; configure CRM and API sync (real-time or scheduled)
4. Sunset or reduce legacy data/enrichment vendors; monitor quality and cost

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Data quality | 50%+ increase (Census) |
| Leads enriched daily | 100k+ (Built In) with minimal manual touch |
| Data vendor cost | ~50% reduction (Census: “cut our costs in half”) |
| Revenue scale with same ops | 3x annual revenue (Leadium) at same profitability |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Single source of truth for GTM data; reps and leaders trust the CRM
- “We don’t have to touch it, it just works” (Built In); less manual hygiene
- One platform for enrichment and engagement; no second data vendor for sequences

## Proof Points

### Customer Example
- **Company**: Census
- **Challenge**: Needed better enrichment quality and breadth than ZoomInfo/Clearbit without the cost
- **Solution**: Replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach with Apollo; used Apollo for enrichment and engagement
- **Results**: “Apollo won on all fronts, especially in enrichment”; 50% increased data quality; cut costs in half
- **Quote**: "We benchmarked ZoomInfo versus Apollo, Clearbit, Lusha, and Seamless, and ultimately Apollo won on all fronts, especially in enrichment. Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit. And we cut our costs in half." — Sylvain Giuliani, Head of Growth & Operations at Census

### Data Points
- Census: 50% data quality increase; replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach; half the cost
- Built In: 100k leads enriched daily; “we don’t really have to touch it, it just works”
- Leadium: 3x annual revenue with Apollo’s open API at same profitability

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How many data and enrichment vendors do you use today, and what’s the combined cost?
2. Where do reps or leaders say the data is wrong or incomplete—coverage, freshness, or too many sources?
3. How do you keep CRM in sync with enrichment—manual, batch, or real-time—and how much time does that take?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Apollo Data coverage and 65+ data points; 91% email accuracy
- Waterfall enrichment and AI Research for custom fields
- CRM sync (on demand, scheduled, real-time); API and integrations
- Comparison to current vendor(s) on quality and cost

### Key Talking Points
- “Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit” (Census)
- “50% data quality improvement and half the cost”
- “100k leads enriched daily without touching it” (Built In)
