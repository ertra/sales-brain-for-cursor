# Use Case: Close Deals With Less Manual Work

## Overview
Sales reps and leaders spend too much time on meeting prep, notes, follow-up, and CRM updates—and lack a single view of pipeline and calls. They use Apollo Deal Execution for pre-meeting insights, call recording and AI summaries, automatic follow-up and CRM sync, and pipeline boards so reps do 50% less manual work and leaders can coach and keep deals moving.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; any vertical where reps run calls and manage pipeline (SaaS, services, enterprise sales)
- **Size**: SMB to enterprise; AEs and BDRs running meetings and updating CRM
- **Characteristics**: Use or have considered Gong, Chili Piper, Calendly; want less admin and better pipeline visibility

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader (pipeline and coaching), SDR/BDR and AE (daily users)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Revenue Operations (CRM and tool stack)

### Trigger Event
- Reps overwhelmed by prep and note-taking; deals slipping from missed follow-up; desire to consolidate meeting scheduler and call tool; need better pipeline and conversation visibility for coaching.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Reps spend significant time on prep, notes, and CRM updates; follow-ups and next steps fall through the cracks
- Pipeline and call insights live in separate tools or spreadsheets; leaders can’t easily coach or spot risks
- Multiple tools for scheduling, calls, and pipeline; high cost and context-switching
- Reps not fully present in meetings because they’re focused on capturing everything

### Desired State (After)
- Reps do ~50% less manual work; pre-meeting insights and AI capture so they’re present in conversations
- Automatic task creation, follow-up emails, and CRM updates from calls
- One place for pipeline, activity, and call insights; leaders coach from data and spot deal risk early
- Option to replace meeting scheduler and call tool with Apollo (one license instead of three)

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Deal Execution (pre-meeting insights, call recording, AI summaries, auto tasks and follow-up, CRM sync, pipeline boards)
- **Supporting**: Apollo Data (company/contact intel for prep); Outbound/Inbound (same platform for full journey)

### Solution Overview
Give reps custom booking links and pre-meeting insights (company and decision-makers) so they prep in seconds. Record calls; use AI to summarize, create tasks, and draft follow-up emails; sync activity and insights to CRM automatically. Leaders use pipeline boards and real-time deal alerts plus conversation insights and dashboards for coaching. All in one platform with data and sequences so no separate scheduler or call intelligence contract.

### Implementation Steps
1. Enable meeting scheduling and pre-meeting insights; connect calendar and CRM
2. Turn on call recording and AI summaries; configure task creation and follow-up templates
3. Set up pipeline boards and deal alerts; train leaders on conversation insights and dashboards
4. Phase out standalone scheduler or call tool if replacing (e.g. Chili Piper)
