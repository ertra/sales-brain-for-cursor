# SDR / BDR

## Role/Title
Sales Development Representative, Business Development Representative, Outbound Rep, Inside Sales

## Responsibilities
- Build lists, run sequences, and book meetings; hit activity and meeting targets
- Research prospects and personalize outreach; maintain deliverability and reply rates
- Use dialer, email, and sometimes LinkedIn; log activity and update CRM
- Work from task lists and playbooks; collaborate with AEs on handoffs

## Company Profile
B2B companies with outbound motion; any size from startup to enterprise. Often report to Sales Leader or BDR Manager; daily users of data, outreach, and dialer tools.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Hours on manual research and list-building; low response and connect rates
- Too many tools (data, sequences, dialer, CRM); context-switching and duplicate data entry
- Deliverability issues; tasks and follow-ups falling through the cracks
- Hard to know what to do next; lack of prioritization and call guidance

## Goals & Objectives
- Book more qualified meetings with less manual work; hit or exceed targets without burning out
- Spend time on conversations, not admin; have clear daily priorities and scripts
- Improve open/reply rates with better data and AI-personalized messaging
- Work in one place (including Chrome) instead of juggling five apps

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Outbound**: AI Assistant to build lists and campaigns from natural language; prioritized task list; built-in parallel dialer; Chrome extension; AI follow-ups and meeting insights
- **Apollo Data**: 65+ data points, verified emails and phones; less research, better targeting
- **Deal Execution**: Pre-meeting insights, call recording and summaries, auto task creation and CRM updates; “50% less manual work”
- One platform: data, email, dialer, and pipeline in one; no switching between ZoomInfo, Outreach, dialer, and CRM

## Buying Process
- Typically don’t buy alone; influenced by Sales Leader and RevOps. Care about ease of use, daily workflow, and “does this make my job easier.”
- Adoption and ramp matter; free tier and trials let them try before team commit

## Communication Preferences
- Productivity: “Hours saved per week,” “prioritized tasks,” “focus on selling not admin”
- Results: “75% more meetings,” “39% open rate with AI,” “book more without the grind”
- Practical: one tool, Chrome extension, less data entry, better prep for calls

## Additional Notes
- Quoted on homepage: “Every rep is more productive with Apollo. We booked 75% more meetings while cutting manual work in half.” (Andrew Froning, BDR Leader). GTM Ops: “4x meetings booked with one SDR as with three.”
