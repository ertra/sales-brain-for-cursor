# Revenue Operations

## Role/Title
RevOps, Revenue Operations, Sales Ops, GTM Ops, VP Revenue Operations, Head of RevOps

## Responsibilities
- Own data quality, enrichment, and CRM hygiene; ensure routing and scoring are accurate
- Manage sales tech stack; integrate data, outreach, and CRM; control cost and complexity
- Support reporting, pipeline visibility, and process; enable reps and leaders with the right tools and data
- Often own vendor selection for data, enrichment, and engagement platforms

## Company Profile
Mid-market and enterprise B2B companies with dedicated RevOps. Common in SaaS, tech, and high-velocity sales; work across sales, marketing, and sometimes customer success.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Stale or incomplete data; multiple enrichment and data vendors; routing and scoring based on poor data
- Tool sprawl (data provider + Outreach/SalesLoft + dialer + enrichment); high cost and integration overhead
- CRM and systems out of sync; manual updates and duplicate records; reps don’t trust data
- Need one source of truth for leads and accounts across GTM

## Goals & Objectives
- Improve data quality and coverage (e.g. 50%+ improvement); single enrichment and data strategy
- Consolidate vendors; replace ZoomInfo + Outreach + point enrichment with one platform; cut cost 50%+
- Keep CRM and downstream tools updated in real time; enable routing, scoring, and personalization from one data layer
- Provide pipeline and conversation insights for coaching and forecasting without adding more tools

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Data Enrichment**: Apollo Data (210M+ contacts, 65+ data points), waterfall enrichment, AI Research; CRM updates on demand or real-time; API and integrations; proof: Census 50% data quality increase, Built In 100k leads enriched daily
- **Apollo Data**: One B2B data source for outbound, inbound, and enrichment; 91% email accuracy; replace ZoomInfo/Clearbit with single vendor
- **Platform**: One stack for data, outbound, inbound, deal execution; sync to Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft; Custom plans for API and enterprise needs
- **Deal Execution**: Pipeline boards, activity sync, call insights; single place for pipeline and rep performance

## Buying Process
- Often lead or heavily influence GTM tool selection; evaluate ROI, integrations, security, and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Compare TCO vs. current stack; want proof on data quality and cost savings; enterprise may require Custom plan and security review

## Communication Preferences
- Data and stack: “50% increased data quality,” “replace ZoomInfo + Outreach,” “one platform,” “CRM and API”
- Outcomes: cost savings, consolidation, real-time sync, routing accuracy, one source of truth
- Governance: compliance, privacy controls, API, and scalability

## Additional Notes
- Census (Head of Growth & Operations): “Apollo won on all fronts, especially in enrichment. Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit. And we cut our costs in half.” Built In VP RevOps: “Apollo enriches everything we have… we don’t really have to touch it.”
