# Sales Leader

## Role/Title
VP Sales, Director of Sales, Head of Business Development, BDR/SDR Leader, Global Director of Business Development

## Responsibilities
- Hit pipeline and revenue targets; scale outbound and inbound without proportional headcount
- Run and coach BDR/SDR teams; improve meeting volume, reply rates, and conversion
- Choose and consolidate sales tech (data, outreach, dialer, CRM); control cost and complexity
- Ensure rep productivity, call quality, and pipeline visibility

## Company Profile
B2B companies of any size—startups to enterprise. Often have dedicated SDR/BDR teams; care about meetings booked, speed to meeting, and tech stack efficiency.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Manual prospecting and busywork; reps not focused on high-value conversations
- Too many tools (data provider + outreach + dialer + enrichment); high cost and complexity
- Inconsistent pipeline; hard to see what’s working and scale winning plays
- Rep performance and coaching limited by lack of call insights and clear priorities
- Inbound leads going cold due to slow follow-up and routing

## Goals & Objectives
- Book more meetings with quality leads; cut time to meeting and double down on what works
- Simplify stack and save 50%+ by replacing multiple vendors with one platform
- Get 4x SDR efficiency (e.g. one SDR doing the work of several) with AI and automation
- Improve pipeline visibility and rep coaching with conversation insights and dashboards

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Outbound**: AI-built lists and campaigns, task prioritization, parallel dialer, deliverability; “book more meetings without the grind”; proof points (75% more meetings, 50% cost savings vs. ZoomInfo + Outreach)
- **Deal Execution**: Pre-meeting insights, call recording/summaries, auto follow-up and CRM updates, pipeline boards, coaching dashboards; 50% less manual work for reps
- **Apollo Data + platform**: One place for data, sequences, and execution; replace five tools with one

## Buying Process
- Often own or heavily influence sales tech decisions; compare ROI and TCO vs. incumbent stack
- Value proof (reviews, case studies, benchmarks); care about implementation speed and adoption
- May involve RevOps for integration and security; enterprise may need Custom plans and procurement

## Communication Preferences
- Outcomes: meetings booked, cost savings, rep productivity, pipeline visibility
- Data and benchmarks: “4x SDR efficiency,” “75% more meetings,” “50% cost savings”
- Consolidation and simplicity: one platform, less admin, reps focused on selling

## Additional Notes
- Title examples from site: “BDR Leader” (Andrew Froning, Cyera), “Founder” (GTM Ops, Predictable Revenue). Often former operators who feel the pain of manual prospecting and tool sprawl.
