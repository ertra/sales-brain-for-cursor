# Marketer

## Role/Title
VP Marketing, Demand Gen, Growth, Marketing Ops, CMO, Head of Inbound

## Responsibilities
- Generate and convert inbound leads; improve conversion and pipeline from website and forms
- Route and qualify leads; ensure hot leads get to the right rep quickly
- Run nurture and follow-up; reduce time-to-meeting and prevent leads going cold
- Support sales with data, enrichment, and alignment on lead quality

## Company Profile
B2B companies with meaningful inbound traffic; often SaaS, tech, or professional services. May have marketing ops; care about conversion rates, routing accuracy, and sales-marketing alignment.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Anonymous visitors and long forms; slow or manual lead routing and follow-up
- Hot leads go cold before sales acts; manual sorting and missed SLAs
- Disconnected tools for forms, enrichment, routing, and email; no single view of inbound performance
- Need better data for personalization and scoring without adding another data vendor

## Goals & Objectives
- Convert more inbound leads into meetings and pipeline; improve conversion rate and speed
- Route leads instantly to the right rep; automate qualification and scheduling; proof points (e.g. 300% routing accuracy improvement)
- Shorten forms and improve quality with real-time enrichment (e.g. email → full profile); one platform for visitor ID, form enrichment, routing, and nurture
- Get analytics on inbound performance and optimize with one system

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Inbound**: Visitor tracking, form enrichment (auto-fill from email), inbound router, meetings scheduler, AI-built workflows; “convert inbound leads into B2B pipeline”
- **Apollo Data**: 65+ data points for scoring and routing; one source for enrichment and personalization
- **Outbound (if running paid/ABM)**: Same data and sequences for targeted campaigns

## Buying Process
- Often partner with sales leadership and RevOps on tool selection; care about integration with CRM and existing forms
- Value ease of setup, routing rules, and time-to-value; may need marketing ops sign-off on data and compliance

## Communication Preferences
- Inbound and conversion: “Don’t let hot leads go cold,” routing accuracy, conversion rate, time-to-meeting
- Data and automation: real-time enrichment, fewer form fields, automated nurture
- Alignment: one platform for marketing and sales, shared data and reporting

## Additional Notes
- Apollo positions “Marketers” as a core role (homepage); use cases include lead scoring, inbound routing, and targeting website visitors. Emerge Market CMO “tripled Apollo spend” for 400% pipeline growth (from magazine).
