# Competitor: Salesloft

Trusted by 5,000+ customers. Platform includes Cadence (pipeline/nurture), Rhythm (actions), Drift (chat), Deals, Conversations (coaching), Forecast; AI agents and revenue orchestration.

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "The Leading AI Revenue Orchestration Platform" / "Put Your Wins on Repeat"
- **Key Message**: One platform for pipeline, deals, forecast, coaching, engagement; AI agents; "revenue teams go to Salesloft to take action"; orchestrate and integrate at scale
- **Target Market**: Revenue leaders, RevOps; "5000+ customers"; enterprise

## Strengths
- Strong orchestration story; Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Drift in one platform
- AI agents and purpose-built AI; Wrike $350K stack savings; NFP $1M+ revenue; 3M 2.5x faster deals
- Drift for chat/website engagement; good for inbound + outbound story
- Enterprise security, governance, integrations

## Weaknesses

- **Cost**: SalesLoft + ZoomInfo = high TCO; Apollo one platform, 50%+ savings in replacement scenarios
- **Complexity**: Full orchestration can mean more modules and implementation; Apollo often simpler for outbound-first and SMB

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Apollo | Salesloft | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| B2B contact/company data | ✅ 210M+ (Apollo Data) | ❌ Use 3rd party | Apollo: one platform; no second data contract |
| Sequences / cadences | ✅ Outbound, Cadence | ✅ Cadence | Both strong; Apollo includes data |
| Built-in dialer | ✅ Parallel dialer | ⚠️ Integrations | Apollo: native dialer |
| Deal management / close | ✅ Deal Execution | ✅ Deals | Both have deal/pipeline |
| Conversation intelligence / coaching | ✅ Call insights, dashboards | ✅ Conversations | Both invest here |
| Chat / website (inbound) | ✅ Inbound (visitor, routing) | ✅ Drift | Salesloft has Drift; Apollo has Inbound |
| Free / low-cost entry | ✅ Free tier | ❌ Enterprise | Apollo: pilot and SMB |
| Data + engagement in one | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Apollo: replace SalesLoft + ZoomInfo |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- Prospect on **SalesLoft + ZoomInfo** (or similar) and wants to **cut cost**; Apollo one platform, 50%+ savings
- Prospect wants **data and sequences in one**; don’t want to manage data vendor and SalesLoft separately
- **Outbound-first** team; need data, lists, sequences, dialer—Apollo all-in-one; 75% more meetings, 4x SDR efficiency proof
- SMB or mid-market; SalesLoft + data too expensive; Apollo free tier and single contract

### When They Win
- Enterprise standardized on Salesloft for orchestration (Cadence, Deals, Conversations, Drift) with separate data strategy
- Heavy Drift/chat dependency and no desire to change; "we're Salesloft + ZoomInfo and happy"
- Procurement or RevOps committed to current stack with no consolidation initiative

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Data included**: 210M contacts, 91% email accuracy in same platform as sequences and dialer; no Salesloft + ZoomInfo two-vendor setup.
2. **One contract**: Replace Salesloft + ZoomInfo with Apollo; 50%+ cost savings (same pattern as Outreach); 64% lower tech stack (Census).
3. **Outbound outcomes**: 75% more meetings, 4x SDR efficiency, 50% less manual work; built-in deliverability and prioritized tasks; free tier to start.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Revenue orchestration" | Strong platform; data from partners | "Apollo orchestrates data + sequences + dialer + pipeline in one. No second data contract." |
| "$350K savings" (Wrike) | They consolidated to Salesloft; still need data elsewhere | "Apollo consolidates data + engagement. Replace both ZoomInfo and Salesloft for 50%+ savings." |
| "5,000+ customers" | Strong footprint | "500,000+ companies use Apollo; we often replace Salesloft + ZoomInfo with one platform and half the cost." |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Salesloft
"Salesloft is a strong orchestration platform. Most teams pair it with ZoomInfo or another data provider—two contracts. Apollo is data and engagement in one: 210M contacts, sequences, dialer, and pipeline. Customers like Census replaced ZoomInfo and their engagement tool with Apollo and cut cost in half with better data quality. Want to see one platform?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Salesloft
1. Ask where they'll get contact/company data; position Apollo as data + engagement in one.
2. Compare total cost of Salesloft + data provider to Apollo all-in.
3. Demo Apollo Outbound + Data (lists, campaigns, tasks, dialer); show one login and outcomes (75% more meetings, 50% less manual work).

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Will you use ZoomInfo or another provider for data with Salesloft?" (Surfaces two-vendor; position Apollo all-in-one.)
2. "What's your total budget for sales engagement and data this year?" (Enables 50% savings story.)
3. "Do you want your reps in one tool for data and sequences, or is two tools acceptable?" (Reinforces single platform.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Apollo | Salesloft |
|--|--------|-----------|
| Model | Credits + seats; free tier | Seats + products; enterprise |
| Entry Price | Free Starter; low-cost paid | Typically enterprise; pricing on request |
| Enterprise | Custom, API | Enterprise |
| Key Differences | Data included; free tier; replace Salesloft + ZoomInfo for 50%+ savings | Orchestration + Drift; no data; usually used with ZoomInfo |
