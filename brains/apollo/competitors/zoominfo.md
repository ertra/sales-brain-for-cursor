# Competitor: ZoomInfo

## Overview
ZoomInfo positions itself as the #1 GTM platform: "The all-in-one AI platform for go-to-market teams" with B2B data, sales AI, lead generation, prospecting, market intelligence, and ABM. Trusted by 35,000+ companies. Strong in enterprise; often used alongside Outreach or SalesLoft for sequences. Apollo frequently wins on enrichment quality, breadth, and total cost when replacing ZoomInfo (e.g. Census: "Higher quality than ZoomInfo, greater breadth than Clearbit. And we cut our costs in half.").

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.zoominfo.com/
- **Founded**: 2007 (as DiscoverOrg; ZoomInfo brand)
- **Headquarters**: Vancouver, WA / Massachusetts
- **Company Size**: Large (public company)
- **Funding/Revenue**: Public (ZI); enterprise-focused pricing
- **Key Customers**: 35,000+ companies; enterprise and mid-market; Seismic, Siemens referenced

## Product Overview
GTM platform built on B2B contact and company data. Products: Sales, Marketing, Recruiting, Operations, GTM Studio (automated plays), Data-as-a-Service. Emphasis on "best B2B data," AI prioritization, verified contacts, intent signals, org charts, and unifying systems. Copilot (generative AI) for research and targeting.

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Sales | Prospecting, engagement, deal prep, forecasting | Apollo Outbound, Deal Execution, Apollo Data |
| Marketing | Segmentation, intent, campaigns, ABM | Apollo Inbound, Apollo Data |
| GTM Studio | Automated GTM plays | Apollo workflows, Outbound |
| Data / DaaS | Contact and company data, enrichment | Apollo Data, Data Enrichment |
| Operations | Unify teams and data | Apollo platform, RevOps use case |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "The #1 GTM Platform" / "The all-in-one AI platform for go-to-market teams"
- **Key Message**: GTM starts with the best B2B data; AI unifies systems, enriches in real time, surfaces intent; one source of truth for execution
- **Target Market**: Enterprise and mid-market GTM teams; sales, marketing, RevOps, recruiting

## Strengths
- Strong brand and enterprise presence; 35,000+ customers
- Broad product set (data, sales, marketing, recruiting, ops)
- Heavy investment in AI (Copilot); intent and firmographic data
- Sales and marketing both on same platform; "single source of truth" messaging
- Proof points: 54% engagement increase, 43% more qualified pipeline, 50% faster prospecting, 40% increase in closed-won deals (customer quotes)

## Weaknesses
- **Cost**: Often significantly more expensive than Apollo; Apollo wins on TCO (Census: "cut our costs in half"; 64% lower tech stack)
- **Enrichment quality**: Apollo cited as higher quality in enrichment in head-to-head (Census benchmark)
- **No native sequences/dialer in one product**: Many accounts still pair ZoomInfo with Outreach/SalesLoft—two contracts and two integrations; Apollo is data + sequences + dialer in one
- **Complexity**: Enterprise feature set can mean longer implementation and more admin

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Apollo | ZoomInfo | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| B2B contact/company data | ✅ 210M+ contacts, 91% email accuracy | ✅ Large database | Apollo: Census benchmark higher enrichment quality; one platform with engagement |
| Sequences + cadences | ✅ Native (Outbound) | ⚠️ Via Sales/Marketing products | Apollo: data + sequences + dialer in one; ZoomInfo often used with Outreach |
| Built-in dialer | ✅ Parallel dialer | ⚠️ Varies by product | Apollo: single platform |
| Enrichment + CRM sync | ✅ Real-time, API, waterfall | ✅ Real-time enrichment | Apollo: "higher quality" (Census); 50%+ cost savings when replacing |
| Inbound / visitor ID / routing | ✅ Native Inbound | ✅ Marketing, lead flow | Apollo: same data as outbound; one contract |
| Free / low-cost entry | ✅ Free tier, trials | ❌ Enterprise pricing | Apollo: easier for SMB and team pilots |
| All-in-one (data + engage + close) | ✅ One platform | ⚠️ Broader but often + Outreach | Apollo: replace ZoomInfo + Outreach with one vendor |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- Prospect wants to **reduce cost** (ZoomInfo + Outreach combined spend); Apollo one platform, 50%+ savings (Predictable Revenue, Census)
- Prospect cares about **enrichment quality**; Apollo wins in benchmarks (Census: "higher quality than ZoomInfo")
- Prospect wants **one vendor** for data, sequences, and dialer; currently on ZoomInfo + Outreach/SalesLoft
- SMB or mid-market; ZoomInfo pricing and complexity are barriers; Apollo has free tier and simpler entry

### When They Win
- Enterprise-only mandate or existing ZoomInfo-wide agreement; procurement prefers incumbent
- Heavy need for ZoomInfo-specific modules (e.g. Recruiting, deep intent partnerships) with no appetite to switch data
- "We already standardized on ZoomInfo" and no champion for consolidation

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **One platform**: Data + outbound + inbound + deal execution in one contract; ZoomInfo often requires Outreach/SalesLoft for full motion—we replace both and cut cost 50%+.
2. **Enrichment quality**: Customer benchmark (Census)—Apollo won on enrichment quality vs. ZoomInfo; same or better outcomes at half the cost.
3. **Total cost and simplicity**: Free tier and transparent pricing; 64% lower tech stack (Census); "why buy five tools when one does it better."

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Best B2B data" | Strong but expensive; Apollo wins on enrichment in head-to-head (Census) | "Census benchmarked ZoomInfo vs. Apollo and chose Apollo for higher enrichment quality and half the cost." |
| "All-in-one GTM" | Often still used with Outreach for sequences; two vendors | "Apollo is data + sequences + dialer in one. One contract, one integration, 50% savings." |
| "Single source of truth" | True within ZoomInfo; enrichment + engagement still split across ZoomInfo + Outreach at many accounts | "Single source of truth plus execution in one platform—no second tool for sequences." |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions ZoomInfo
"ZoomInfo is a strong data player. Many teams run ZoomInfo plus Outreach or SalesLoft for sequences—two contracts and two integrations. Apollo is data and engagement in one platform. Customers like Census compared ZoomInfo to Apollo and switched for higher enrichment quality and 50% cost savings. Want to see how one platform could replace both?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating ZoomInfo
1. Ask total cost of ZoomInfo + any engagement tool (Outreach/SalesLoft); compare to Apollo all-in.
2. Ask who owns enrichment quality and CRM sync; share Census outcome (50% data quality increase, half the cost).
3. Demo Apollo Data + Outbound + optional Deal Execution; show one login, one pipeline view, one contract.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Are you also looking at Outreach or SalesLoft for sequences, or is ZoomInfo covering that too?" (Surfaces two-vendor setup.)
2. "What's your all-in spend on data and outreach tools today?" (Surfaces cost for consolidation message.)
3. "Have you run a data quality or enrichment benchmark lately? Customers often see 50%+ improvement and lower cost when they compare." (Opens door for Apollo proof.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Apollo | ZoomInfo |
|--|--------|----------|
| Model | Credits + seats; free tier | Enterprise; contact/data-based |
| Entry Price | Free Starter; paid from low cost | Typically higher; contact sales |
| Enterprise | Custom plans, API | Enterprise contracts |
| Key Differences | Free tier; one platform (data + engage); often 50%+ savings when replacing ZoomInfo + Outreach | Strong enterprise brand; often sold with Outreach for full motion; higher TCO |
