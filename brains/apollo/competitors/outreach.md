# Competitor: Outreach

## Overview
Outreach positions as the "AI Revenue Workflow Platform" for sales, marketing, RevOps, and GTM teams. Focus on AI agents, workflows, forecasting, coaching, and deal management—"the only end-to-end sales solution" to prospect, forecast, coach, close, renew, and expand. Does not include its own B2B contact/company database; typically used with ZoomInfo or another data provider. Apollo wins when prospects want one platform (data + sequences + dialer) and 50%+ cost savings vs. ZoomInfo + Outreach.

## Company Information

- **Founded**: 2014
- **Headquarters**: Seattle, WA

Security, privacy, governance. Over 2 million opportunities closed per month (claimed). Integrates with CRM and other tools; no native B2B data—customers bring ZoomInfo, Apollo, or others.

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Platform (Sales AI, workflows) | Sequences, engagement, forecasting, coaching, deal management | Apollo Outbound, Deal Execution |
| AI Agents | Prospect, engage, forecast, coach, close, retain | Apollo AI Assistant, workflows |
| (Data) | Not included; use ZoomInfo, Apollo, etc. | Apollo Data included in platform |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "AI Revenue Workflow Platform" / "One AI-powered platform for revenue teams"
- **Key Message**: Workflow first, results driven; AI agents for every use case; forecast, coach, close, renew, expand, build pipeline in one system
- **Target Market**: Sales leaders, marketing, RevOps, customer success; enterprise revenue teams

## Strengths
- Strong sales engagement brand; trusted by many enterprise teams
- AI agents and workflows; forecasting, coaching, deal management
- Proof: Amplitude $600K+ savings, 5 platforms → 1; "sales leaders trust Outreach"
- Security, privacy, governance; enterprise-ready

## Weaknesses
- **No B2B data**: Requires separate data vendor (ZoomInfo, Apollo, etc.)—two contracts, two integrations; Apollo includes 210M contacts in one platform
- **Cost when combined with ZoomInfo**: ZoomInfo + Outreach = high TCO; Apollo replaces both and often delivers 50%+ savings (Predictable Revenue, Census)
- **Dialer**: May use separate dialer or add-on; Apollo has built-in parallel dialer in same product
- **Complexity**: Full revenue workflow can mean more implementation; Apollo often faster to value for outbound-first teams

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Apollo | Outreach | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| B2B contact/company data | ✅ 210M+ (Apollo Data) | ❌ Use 3rd party | Apollo: one platform; no second data contract |
| Sequences / cadences | ✅ Native | ✅ Native | Both strong; Apollo adds data + dialer |
| Built-in dialer | ✅ Parallel dialer | ⚠️ Varies | Apollo: one product |
| AI agents / workflows | ✅ AI Assistant, workflows | ✅ AI agents | Both investing in AI |
| Forecasting / coaching | ✅ Deal Execution, insights | ✅ Core focus | Outreach strong in forecast/coach; Apollo bundles with data + sequences |
| Free / low-cost entry | ✅ Free tier | ❌ Enterprise | Apollo: easier pilot and SMB |
| Data + engagement in one | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (need ZoomInfo etc.) | Apollo: replace Outreach + ZoomInfo |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- Prospect is on **ZoomInfo + Outreach** and wants to cut cost; Apollo one platform, 50%+ savings
- Prospect wants **data and sequences in one place**; no desire to manage two vendors
- SMB or mid-market; Outreach pricing and ZoomInfo add-on are too heavy; Apollo free tier and all-in-one
- Team is **outbound-first**; need data, lists, sequences, dialer—Apollo delivers in one; "book more meetings without the grind" (75% more meetings, 50% less manual work)

### When They Win
- Enterprise standardized on Outreach for forecasting, coaching, and deal management with separate data strategy
- "We're committed to ZoomInfo for data and only need engagement" with no consolidation goal
- Heavy reliance on Outreach-specific workflows or integrations with no appetite to migrate

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Data included**: No second vendor for contacts/companies; 210M contacts, 91% email accuracy, 65+ data points in same platform as sequences and dialer.
2. **One contract, one integration**: Replace Outreach + ZoomInfo (or similar) with Apollo; 50% cost savings (Predictable Revenue); 64% lower tech stack (Census).
3. **Outbound outcomes**: 75% more meetings, 4x SDR efficiency, 50% less manual work (Cyera, GTM Ops); built-in deliverability and prioritized task list.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "End-to-end sales solution" | Strong on workflow; data is from partners (ZoomInfo, etc.) | "Apollo is end-to-end with data included—no second data contract. One platform, 50% savings." |
| "Reduce tech stack" (Amplitude) | They consolidated to Outreach; still need data elsewhere | "Apollo consolidates data + sequences + dialer. Replace both ZoomInfo and Outreach." |
| "60% seller productivity" | Strong claim; Apollo has 50% less manual work, 4x SDR efficiency | "We deliver 75% more meetings and 50% less manual work with one platform—data included." |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Outreach
"Outreach is a strong workflow platform. Most teams pair it with ZoomInfo or another data provider—that's two contracts and two integrations. Apollo is data and engagement in one: 210M contacts, sequences, and dialer. Customers like Predictable Revenue and Census replaced ZoomInfo + Outreach with Apollo and cut cost 50%+ while increasing meetings and data quality. Want to see one platform in action?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Outreach
1. Clarify where they'll get contact/company data (ZoomInfo, Apollo, other); introduce Apollo as data + engagement in one.
2. Ask total cost of Outreach + data provider; compare to Apollo all-in.
3. Demo Apollo Outbound + Apollo Data (lists, campaigns, tasks, dialer); show one login and one pipeline.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Where will you get your contact and company data if you go with Outreach?" (Surfaces need for ZoomInfo/Apollo—position Apollo as all-in-one.)
2. "What's the combined annual spend for Outreach plus your data provider?" (Sets up consolidation and 50% savings story.)
3. "How important is it to have data and sequences in the same tool so reps don't switch context?" (Reinforces one platform.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Apollo | Outreach |
|--|--------|----------|
| Model | Credits + seats; free tier | Seats + modules; enterprise |
| Entry Price | Free Starter; low-cost paid | Typically enterprise; get pricing |
| Enterprise | Custom, API | Enterprise contracts |
| Key Differences | Data included; free tier; often 50%+ savings vs. Outreach + ZoomInfo | Workflow/AI focus; no data; usually used with ZoomInfo |
