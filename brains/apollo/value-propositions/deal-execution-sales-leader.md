# Deal Execution → Sales Leader Value Proposition

## Summary
Apollo Deal Execution gives sales leaders pipeline visibility, call insights, and rep productivity in one place. Reps get pre-meeting insights, AI call summaries, automatic follow-up and CRM updates, and pipeline boards—so leaders can coach on what matters and keep deals moving while reps do 50% less manual work and close more.

## The Problem
Leaders lack a clear view of pipeline and rep performance; coaching is limited without call insights. Reps spend too much time on prep, notes, and CRM updates instead of selling; follow-ups and next steps slip, and deals stall.

## The Solution
Deal Execution combines pre-meeting insights, call recording and AI summaries, automatic task creation and follow-up emails, CRM sync, pipeline boards, and real-time deal alerts. Leaders get conversation insights and performance dashboards; reps get a single place to prep, run meetings, and move deals.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Reps do 50% less manual work
- **Benefit**: AI captures key points from calls, creates tasks, and updates CRM; reps focus on conversations instead of admin.
- **Proof Point**: Cyera: "Reps are now doing 50% less manual work. Their meetings are scheduled, their emails are personalized, workflows automated, and their CRM is integrated."
- **Customer Quote**: "Reps are now doing 50% less manual work. Their meetings are scheduled, their emails are personalized, workflows automated, and their CRM is integrated. They're now conducting the orchestra—not playing every instrument." — Andrew Froning, Global Director of Business Development at Cyera

### 2. Pipeline visibility and coaching
- **Benefit**: Deal, activity, and contact data in one place; pipeline boards and deal alerts; call insights and dashboards to coach reps and spot risks.
- **Proof Point**: FLO EV: $2.3M revenue sourced through Apollo; reps present in meetings while Apollo captures key points. Bitrise: consolidated tools (e.g. replaced Chili Piper), one license instead of three.
- **Customer Quote**: "Apollo Conversations allows me to be truly present in meetings instead of feverishly taking notes. I can listen to what the client is saying and respond thoughtfully, while Apollo captures key points, pain points, and next steps." — Reid Merlotti, Business Development Manager for National Accounts at FLO EV ($2.3M revenue sourced through Apollo)

### 3. Simplify stack and keep deals moving
- **Benefit**: Pre-meeting insights and scheduling in one platform; no separate meeting scheduler or call tool; CRM stays updated automatically.
- **Proof Point**: Bitrise: "We got rid of Chili Piper because we now have, in Apollo, this better Meetings feature. Why would we not use the better feature? Now instead of paying three licenses, we pay for one."
- **Customer Quote**: "We wanted to consolidate our tools. We got rid of Chili Piper because we now have, in Apollo, this better Meetings feature. Why would we not use the better feature? Now instead of paying three licenses, we pay for one." — Jens Stöckel, Regional Sales Manager at Bitrise

## Quantified Value

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Manual work (reps) | High (notes, CRM, follow-up) | 50% less (Cyera) | 50% reduction |
| Revenue sourced (example) | — | $2.3M (FLO EV) | $2.3M through Apollo |
| Meeting tools / cost | 3 licenses (e.g. Chili Piper + others) | 1 (Apollo) | Consolidation; cost savings |
