# Outbound → SDR/BDR Value Proposition

## Summary
Apollo Outbound gives SDRs and BDRs one place to find leads, run campaigns, and connect—with AI that builds lists and sequences in minutes, a prioritized task list, built-in dialer and deliverability, and fewer tools so they spend time on conversations, not admin. Reps book more meetings and cut manual work in half while improving open and reply rates.

## The Problem
SDRs/BDRs waste hours on list-building and research, juggle multiple tools (data, sequences, dialer, CRM), and struggle with deliverability and knowing what to do next. They miss follow-ups and burn out on busywork instead of selling.

## The Solution
Apollo Outbound combines Apollo Data (65+ data points, verified emails/phones), an AI Assistant that builds lists and campaigns from natural language, a prioritized daily task list, parallel dialer, Chrome extension, and built-in deliverability. Reps get AI-powered meeting insights and follow-ups so nothing falls through the cracks.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Build lists and campaigns in minutes, not hours
- **Benefit**: AI builds lists and multichannel campaigns from simple prompts; real-time data to pinpoint the right buyers; less research, more outreach.
- **Proof Point**: Neurofit: 100+ hours of manual research saved across 3 BDRs; 39% open rate with AI-written messages without writing one-by-one.
- **Customer Quote**: "We've saved 100+ hours of manual research across three full-time BDRs. I'm seeing a 39% open rate using AI Power-ups to write personalized messages for my sequence... which is incredible considering I didn't write them one by one." — Alexander Theodorou, Founder & CEO at Neurofit

### 2. One place to work—no more tab chaos
- **Benefit**: Data, sequences, dialer, and tasks in one platform; Chrome extension to execute from anywhere; 50% less manual work.

- **Customer Quote**: "Every rep is more productive with Apollo. We booked 75% more meetings while cutting manual work in half." — Andrew Froning, BDR Leader at Cyera

### 3. Prioritized tasks and follow-ups that don’t slip
- **Benefit**: Start each day with the most important actions; call scripts and AI follow-ups; deliverability guardrails so emails land.
- **Proof Point**: Higher reply and open rates (Predictable Revenue); meetings up, speed to booking cut in half.
- **Customer Quote**: "We're getting higher reply rates, open rates are doubled, meetings are up, and speed to booking a meeting is cut in half." — Collin Steward, CEO at Predictable Revenue

Tell the AI what you're going after and it builds the list and campaign. You get a prioritized task list every day, built-in deliverability, and AI follow-ups so you book more meetings and do half the manual work. Teams like Cyera booked 75% more meetings and cut manual work in half."
