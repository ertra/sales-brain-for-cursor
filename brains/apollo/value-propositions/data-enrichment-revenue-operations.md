# Data Enrichment → Revenue Operations Value Proposition

## Summary
Apollo Data and Data Enrichment give RevOps one B2B data source for the entire GTM motion: 210M+ contacts, 91% email accuracy, 65+ data points, waterfall enrichment, and real-time or scheduled CRM updates. Replace ZoomInfo, Clearbit, and point enrichment with one platform—improve data quality 50%+ and cut cost in half while keeping CRM and downstream tools in sync.

## The Problem
RevOps struggles with stale or incomplete data, multiple enrichment and data vendors, and CRM/systems out of sync. Routing and scoring suffer; reps don’t trust data; cost and integration overhead are high.

## The Solution
Apollo Data is the single B2B data layer; Data Enrichment adds waterfall enrichment, AI Research, and CRM/API sync (on demand, scheduled, or real-time). One source for outbound, inbound, and enrichment; 91% email accuracy; integrations to Salesforce, HubSpot, and the rest of the stack.
