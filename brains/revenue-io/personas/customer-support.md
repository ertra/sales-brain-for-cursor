# Customer Support

## Role/Title
VP/Director of Customer Support, Support Manager, Support Team Lead, Customer Support Representative

## Responsibilities
- Resolve issues faster; deliver consistent, high-quality customer experiences
- Reduce escalations and improve first-call resolution; spot trends early
- Reduce repetitive work (logging, lookups); free agents to focus on customers
- Use full visibility in Salesforce for cases, history, and context

## Company Profile
B2B companies with internal or hybrid support teams—mid-market to enterprise. Often use Salesforce for cases and customer data; care about resolution time and satisfaction.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Slow resolutions; agents struggle to access information quickly, leading to longer response times and frustrated customers
- Inconsistent performance; without real-time coaching, agents deliver uneven service quality
- High escalations; recurring issues go unresolved, customers repeat concerns, escalations increase
- Repetitive work; agents waste time logging cases and searching for information

## Goals & Objectives
- Deliver faster, more effective support; resolve cases faster and more accurately
- Boost first-call resolution and reduce escalations; give agents full context (360° view of past interactions)
- Reduce repetitive work and improve productivity; automate logging, summaries, and CRM updates
- Turn support into a growth engine; build loyalty and reduce churn with better experiences

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Real-time guidance + Moments**: Live coaching and AI-driven prompts during support calls; consistent, high-quality experience; “Show me Moments” for in-call help
- **360° view**: Complete view of past customer interactions so agents resolve issues on the first call; fewer escalations
- **Automation**: Automate knowledge base lookups, call summaries, and CRM updates; agents focus on customers, not admin
- **Conversation Intelligence**: Every conversation becomes an opportunity; AI-powered insights, automation, and real-time coaching
- **Revenue Platform**: “Resolve issues faster, spot trends early, and deliver exceptional customer experiences with complete visibility in Salesforce.”
- FAQs (role page): faster resolution (real-time access to history, summaries, KB); consistency (live coaching, AI prompts); fewer escalations (full context on first call); automation (logging, summaries, CRM updates); loyalty (faster, more accurate, personalized support)

## Buying Process
- Often own or influence support tech; partner with RevOps/IT for Salesforce and tooling
- Value resolution time, first-call resolution, and agent productivity; care about consistency and coaching
- May evaluate alongside sales/CS platform if same vendor (Revenue.io spans sales + support)

## Communication Preferences
- Outcomes: faster resolutions, higher first-call resolution, fewer escalations, higher satisfaction
- Messaging: “deliver faster, more effective support,” “boost first-call resolution,” “reduce repetitive work,” “turn support into a growth engine”
- Proof: real-time guidance, 360° view, automation, case study (role page “Read the Case Study”)

## Additional Notes
- Scraped from https://www.revenue.io/role-customer-support. Headlines: “Deliver faster resolutions and better experiences”; “Turn Support Into a Growth Engine With Revenue.io”; challenges: slow resolutions, inconsistent performance, high escalations, repetitive work.
