## Company Profile
B2B companies with dedicated RevOps—mid-market to enterprise. Salesforce is system of record; care about one platform and clean data.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Disconnected tools; data loss and duplicate or incomplete records in Salesforce

## Goals & Objectives
- Automate workflows and unify GTM data on one Salesforce-native platform
- Consolidate stack; fewer vendors, one source of truth for calls and engagement
- Maximize data capture and context in Salesforce; automatic logging and real-time visibility
- Keep team compliant (TCPA, GDPR, etc.) with built-in controls

- **CallerDNA / Lead Response**: Call tracking, routing, attribution; connect activities to revenue impact
- **Enterprise security**: HIPAA, TCPA, GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2; role-based access and AI governance

## Buying Process

- Work with security/compliance on certifications; may drive RFP or POC

## Communication Preferences
