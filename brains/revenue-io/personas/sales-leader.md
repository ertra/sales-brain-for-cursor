# Sales Leader

## Role/Title
VP Sales, Director of Sales, Head of Sales, Sales Manager, Global Director of Business Development

## Responsibilities
- Hit pipeline and revenue targets; improve forecast accuracy and quota attainment
- Coach reps in real time and at scale; gain complete pipeline visibility and control in Salesforce
- Run inside sales, SDR, and AE teams; improve connection rates, meeting volume, and deal execution
- Choose and consolidate sales tech (dialer, engagement, conversation AI, forecasting); control cost and complexity

## Company Profile
B2B companies running on Salesforce—mid-market to enterprise. Often have dedicated SDR/AE teams; care about rep productivity, deal health, and one platform for the entire GTM.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Inconsistent rep performance; coaching is post-hoc and doesn’t scale
- Poor forecast accuracy; pipeline risks surface too late
- Too many tools (dialer, engagement, conversation AI) with disconnected data
- No real-time visibility into deal health and rep execution
- Reps not following methodology or best practices

## Goals & Objectives
- Improve forecast accuracy and pipeline visibility; reduce risk and surprises
- Coach reps in real time (not just after the call) so every rep sells like the best rep
- Consolidate stack on one Salesforce-native platform; eliminate data loss and tool-jumping
- Hit quota consistently with AI-guided next steps and deal execution

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Sales Forecasting + Deal Execution**: Real-time deal insights, deal health, forecast analyzer; visibility into every opportunity in Salesforce
- **Rep Coaching + Moments**: AI-driven feedback, scorecards, and live in-call guidance so reps handle objections and follow methodology
- **Revenue Platform**: One platform for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, and forecasting; 120% quota attainment, $300K rep productivity (site proof points)
- **Conversation Intelligence**: Record, analyze, and coach every conversation; identify key moments and winning behaviors

## Buying Process
- Often own or heavily influence sales tech decisions; compare ROI vs. incumbent stack
- Value proof (HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings); care about implementation and adoption
- May involve RevOps for Salesforce integration and security; enterprise may need compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2)

## Communication Preferences
- Outcomes: forecast accuracy, quota attainment, rep productivity, pipeline visibility
- Proof: “120% quota attainment,” “60% reduction in rep ramp time,” “real-time coaching”
- Consolidation: one Salesforce-native platform, no more jumping between tools
