# Account Executive

## Role/Title
Account Executive, AE, Sales Representative, Enterprise Account Manager, Inside Sales Representative

## Responsibilities
- Close deals faster; manage pipeline and opportunities in Salesforce
- Conduct calls and meetings with prospects; follow up consistently and move deals forward
- Hit quota; maintain accurate forecast and next-step discipline
- Collaborate with SDRs, SEs, and leadership on deal strategy

## Company Profile
B2B companies running on Salesforce—any size. AEs carry quota and need full context (calls, emails, CRM) in one place.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Manual work: logging calls, writing follow-ups, updating CRM; less time selling
- Inaccurate or delayed forecasting; deal risks and next steps unclear
- Context scattered across dialer, email, and CRM; no single view of the deal
- Missing best practices and in-call guidance; inconsistent execution

## Goals & Objectives
- Eliminate manual work and close deals faster with real-time visibility in Salesforce
- Forecast accurately; know deal health, risks, and recommended next steps
- Have complete context (calls, emails, notes) in one place before and during calls
- Get live guidance during calls to handle objections and follow playbooks

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Deal Execution**: Opportunity summaries, deal scorecards, next-step guidance; “Ask about an opportunity” for risks and actions
- **Moments (Real-Time Guidance)**: Live in-call guidance to handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence
- **Conversation AI**: Auto summaries, follow-up emails, call scorecards; less manual note-taking and CRM updates

- **Revenue Platform**: One place for calls, deals, and guidance; “close deals faster with complete context from calls, emails, and CRM data”

## Buying Process
- Often influence or co-decide with sales leadership and RevOps; care about ease of use and adoption
- Value less admin, more selling; want tools that don’t add steps
- May be included in pilot or rollout; feedback on rep experience matters

## Communication Preferences
- Outcomes: less manual work, faster close, accurate forecast, full context
- Messaging: “complete context in one place,” “real-time visibility,” “close deals faster”
- Avoid: extra steps, another tool to log into, post-call-only insights
