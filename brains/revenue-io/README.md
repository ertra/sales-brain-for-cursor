# Revenue.io Sales Brain

Human-friendly overview of the Revenue.io sales intelligence in this folder. For AI agents and file-level loading rules, see **INDEX.md**.

## What Is This?

This is a **Sales Brain** for **Revenue.io**—a structured set of markdown files that capture company info, products, personas, pain points, value propositions, use cases, competitors, objections, case studies, and sales plays. Use it for enablement, competitive prep, and consistent messaging.

## Revenue.io in One Sentence

Revenue.io is the **#1 Revenue Orchestration Platform** for Salesforce—combining the **#1 Salesforce-native dialer** (RingDNA), sales engagement, conversation AI, **real-time in-call guidance (Moments)**, rep coaching, and forecasting in **one platform**, so teams scale meetings (HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings), coach when it matters, and consolidate dialer + Gong/Outreach/Salesloft into one vendor.

## Proof Points to Remember

| Customer | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **HPE** | **400%** more sales opportunities; **400%** increase in call pickup rates; **100%** insight and **100%** user adoption; global 150+ countries |
| **NFI Industries** | **10x** more monthly meetings; **8x** more conversations; one rep **$50K → seven-figure** pace; "immense benefit" for coaching |
| **Fundera** | "First sales system we're **unequivocally happy with**"; streamlined workflows |
| **OrthoFX** | **60%** productivity increase; **20%+** MoM patient conversions; **60%** more outbound; only platform that met Salesforce-native requirement |
| **Vagaro** | Time to first call **48h → 3.5 min**; **70%** conversion boost; **400%** quota attainment |
| **FreshBooks** | **90–100** calls/day (from 30–40); pickup **11% → 21%**; "best sales productivity investment this year" |
| **Nutanix** | **2+ hours** saved per rep per day; live call coaching from anywhere |

## Key Differentiators

1. **#1 Salesforce-native dialer in the same platform** — RingDNA (Revenue.io) is the dialer; no separate vendor. Every call in Salesforce and in Conversation AI.
2. **Real-time in-call guidance (Moments)** — Coach reps during the call, not just after. Handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence when it matters. Gong/Outreach/Salesloft focus on post-call.
3. **One platform for Salesforce** — Dialer, engagement, conversation AI, Moments, rep coaching, forecasting in one contract and one data model. Consolidate and keep Salesforce clean.
4. **Salesforce-only** — Built only for Salesforce; deeper native integration, automatic logging, one source of truth.
