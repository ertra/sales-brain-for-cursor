# Sales Play: Replace Dialer + Gong/Outreach/Salesloft (Consolidation)

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Replace Dialer + Gong/Outreach/Salesloft (Consolidation) |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Leader, Revenue Operations |
| **Target Company** | B2B on Salesforce; using separate dialer + engagement and/or conversation intelligence (Gong, Outreach, Salesloft); mid-market to enterprise |
| **Products** | Revenue.io platform (Salesforce Dialer, Guided Selling, Conversation AI, Moments, Rep Coaching, Sales Forecasting) |
| **Trigger Event** | Dialer or engagement or Gong/Outreach/Salesloft renewal; new RevOps/sales leader pushing fewer tools; Salesforce data quality issues |
| **Play Type** | Competitive / Consolidation |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Dialer, Outreach, Salesloft, or Gong contract renewal (3–6 months out)
- New sales leader or RevOps with mandate to simplify stack
- Budget or finance push to reduce sales tech spend
- Reps or RevOps complaining about too many tools, broken Salesforce data, or no real-time coaching

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Using Salesforce; separate dialer + (Outreach or Salesloft or Gong) in tech stack
- Job posts or LinkedIn for RevOps, Sales Ops; "consolidate tools" or "Salesforce-native" in priorities
- Recently missed forecast or quota; cost-cutting or "one platform" initiative

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | Mid-market to enterprise; inside sales or SDR/AE teams |
| Industry | B2B; any vertical on Salesforce |
| Tech Stack | Salesforce; dialer (any) + engagement and/or conversation intelligence (Gong, Outreach, Salesloft) |
| Budget | Currently spending on 2+ vendors for dialer, engagement, or CI |

## The Play

### Objective
Replace separate dialer and engagement/CI vendors with one Revenue.io platform on Salesforce; deliver one contract, automatic logging, real-time in-call guidance (Moments), and proof (HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings, Fundera "unequivocally happy").

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"One Salesforce-native platform for dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and real-time in-call guidance. No separate dialer—the #1 Salesforce dialer is built in. Reps get live guidance during the call with Moments, not just post-call insights. HPE saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings; Fundera said it's the first sales system they're unequivocally happy with. One contract, one integration, clean Salesforce."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 15–20 minutes

- [ ] Confirm current stack (dialer? Outreach? Salesloft? Gong?); estimate combined annual spend
- [ ] Note renewal dates for dialer and engagement/CI contracts
- [ ] Identify champion (Sales Leader, RevOps); any "consolidate tools" or Salesforce data quality initiative
- [ ] Prepare HPE, NFI, Fundera, OrthoFX one-liners and case study links

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Tuesday–Thursday

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: One platform for dialer + engagement + coaching—HPE saw 400% more opportunities

Hi {First Name},

Most teams on Salesforce run a separate dialer plus Outreach, Salesloft, or Gong—multiple contracts and still no real-time coaching during the call.

Revenue.io is one Salesforce-native platform: #1 dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and live in-call guidance (Moments). HPE saw 400% more sales opportunities and 100% adoption; NFI saw 10x more monthly meetings. Fundera called it the first sales system they're unequivocally happy with.

If your dialer or engagement renewal is coming up, worth a 15-min comparison—one contract, one integration, clean Salesforce.

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How many vendors do you have today for dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence—and what's the total cost?
2. When do those contracts renew?
3. Is your dialer part of the same product as your conversation intelligence—and do reps get any live guidance during the call?
4. How complete is your Salesforce activity data—manual or automatic?
5. Would consolidating to one Salesforce-native platform be a priority if it gave you real-time in-call coaching and one integration?

**Key Points to Cover**:
- One platform = #1 Salesforce dialer + engagement + CI + Moments (real-time guidance)
- HPE 400% more opportunities, 100% adoption; NFI 10x meetings; Fundera, OrthoFX consolidation
- Automatic logging; no data loss between tools

### Step 4: Demo
**Demo Flow**:
1. Salesforce-native dialer (click-to-dial, automatic logging)
2. Conversation AI (summaries, scorecards) + Moments (real-time in-call guidance)
3. Deal Execution / Forecasting (visibility in Salesforce)
4. One admin, one data model

**Features to Highlight**:
- #1 Salesforce dialer in same platform as CI (no separate dialer)
- Moments = live guidance during the call (differentiator vs. Gong/Outreach)
- Automatic capture = clean Salesforce (RevOps)

### Step 5: Proposal & Close
**Proposal Elements**:
- One platform pricing vs. current multi-vendor spend
- Implementation: Salesforce-native, phased rollout (e.g. dialer first, then full platform)
- References: HPE, NFI, Fundera, OrthoFX

**Negotiation Levers**:
- Consolidation savings; payback from single contract and less integration
- Pilot or proof of value before full commitment

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We're happy with Gong/Outreach" | "Do you have the #1 Salesforce dialer in the same platform—and do reps get live guidance during the call? Revenue.io is both; one platform for Salesforce teams." |
| "We might move off Salesforce" | "Revenue.io is built only for Salesforce. If you're on Salesforce for the next 2–3 years, we're the fit; if multi-CRM, we're not." |
| "Implementation would be disruptive" | "Salesforce-native = no separate data layer. Phased rollout: dialer and logging first, then Moments and coaching. HPE rolled out across multiple countries." |
| "Need to check with boss/RevOps" | "We can join a call with them. We have ROI proof and case studies (HPE, NFI, Fundera); we can provide a one-pager for internal buy-in." |
