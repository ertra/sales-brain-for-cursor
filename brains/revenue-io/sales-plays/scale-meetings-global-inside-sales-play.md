| Budget | Invested in inside sales; open to platform for dialer + engagement + guidance |

## The Play

### Objective
Win deals where the prospect needs to scale meeting volume and/or sales opportunities without proportionally adding headcount—with proof: HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x more monthly meetings, Vagaro 48h→3.5min first call and 70% conversion. Position #1 Salesforce-native dialer + real-time guidance (Moments) + lead response in one platform.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Scale meetings and opportunities on one platform. HPE saw 400% more sales opportunities and 100% adoption across 150+ countries. NFI saw 10x more monthly meetings and 8x more conversations; one rep went from $50K to seven-figure pace. Vagaro cut time to first call from 48 hours to 3.5 minutes and saw 70% conversion boost. Revenue.io gives you the #1 Salesforce-native dialer, instant lead response, and real-time in-call guidance—so reps connect faster and convert more."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 15 minutes

- [ ] Confirm current meeting volume and dialer/engagement setup; any global (multi-country) requirement
- [ ] Identify champion (Sales Leader, SDR lead); pipeline or meeting goals
- [ ] Prepare HPE, NFI, Vagaro, FreshBooks proof (400%, 10x, 48h→3.5min, 90–100 calls/day)

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Tuesday–Thursday

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: 400% more opportunities (HPE) / 10x more meetings (NFI)—one platform

Hi {First Name},

HPE's global inside sales team saw 400% more sales opportunities with Revenue.io. NFI saw 10x more monthly meetings—one rep went from $50K to seven-figure pace.

Revenue.io is the #1 Salesforce-native dialer with real-time in-call guidance and instant lead response—one platform so reps connect faster and convert more. 100% adoption at HPE; Vagaro cut time to first call from 48 hours to 3.5 minutes and boosted conversions 70%.

If you're scaling meetings or evaluating your dialer/engagement stack, worth a 15-min look.

```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How many qualified meetings do you need per month—and how many reps do you have to get there?
2. When a high-intent lead comes in, how quickly do they get a first call—and is every call logged to Salesforce?
3. Are your reps making more dials and connecting more, or is volume capped by tools and manual work?
4. Do you have one platform for dialer and engagement, or multiple tools that don't sync cleanly?
5. (If global) Do you need local presence or multi-country dialing?

**Key Points to Cover**:
- #1 Salesforce-native dialer; automatic logging; HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings
- Real-time guidance (Moments) so reps convert more conversations
- Lead response (Hot Leads) for instant connection; Vagaro 48h→3.5min
- Global: HPE 150+ countries; Dynamic Local Presence

### Step 4: Demo
**Demo Flow**:
1. Salesforce-native dialer (click-to-dial, automatic logging, local presence if global)
2. Lead routing / Hot Leads (instant response, attribution)
3. Moments (real-time in-call guidance)
4. Call analytics and outcomes in Salesforce

**Features to Highlight**:
- More dials, higher connection rates (HPE quote)
- 10x meetings (NFI); 400% more opportunities (HPE)
- Instant lead response (Vagaro, RE/MAX); 90–100 calls/day (FreshBooks)

### Step 5: Proposal & Close
**Proposal Elements**:
- Platform: dialer + engagement + Moments + (optional) lead response
- Proof: HPE, NFI, Vagaro, FreshBooks
- Implementation: Salesforce-native; phased rollout if needed

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We're happy with our dialer" | "Is it the #1 Salesforce-native dialer with conversation AI and real-time guidance in the same platform? Revenue.io gives you dialer + coaching + intelligence in one—HPE saw 400% more opportunities." |
| "We need more proof" | "HPE 400% more opportunities, 100% adoption; NFI 10x meetings, seven-figure rep story; Vagaro 48h→3.5min, 70% conversion; FreshBooks 90–100 calls/day, double pickup rate. We can set up a pilot or reference call." |
| "Not the right time" | "Every quarter without real-time coaching and one platform is another quarter of missed meetings. If your dialer or engagement renewal is coming up, that's the ideal time to compare." |
