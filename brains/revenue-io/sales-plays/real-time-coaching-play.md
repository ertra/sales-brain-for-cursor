### Qualification Criteria

| Company Size | Mid-market to enterprise; 10+ reps |
| Industry | B2B; any vertical on Salesforce |
| Tech Stack | Salesforce; may have Gong or similar for post-call insights |
| Budget | Invested in enablement or conversation intelligence |

## The Play

### Objective
Win deals where the prospect wants to scale coaching and improve rep performance with real-time in-call guidance (Moments) and AI-driven rep coaching—not just post-call insights. Differentiate from Gong and others that focus on after-the-fact.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Coach reps when it matters—during the call. Revenue.io Moments gives reps live guidance: handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence. Rep Coaching adds AI scorecards and feedback on every call. 60% reduction in rep ramp time; NFI's sales manager said anyone in leadership looking to coach and improve rep performance will find 'immense benefit.' Not post-call only—real-time."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 15 minutes

- [ ] Confirm current coaching approach (Gong? post-call only? no tool?)
- [ ] Identify champion (Sales Leader, Enablement); any ramp or quota initiative
- [ ] Prepare Moments demo (in-call guidance); 60% ramp reduction; NFI, OrthoFX, HireRight quotes

### Step 2: Initial Outreach
**Channel**: Email + LinkedIn
**Timing**: Tuesday–Thursday

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: Scale coaching with real-time guidance—not just after the call

Hi {First Name},

Most coaching happens after the call—when the moment's gone. Revenue.io gives reps live guidance during the call (Moments): handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence when it matters.

We also deliver 60% reduction in rep ramp time and AI scorecards on every call. NFI's sales manager said anyone in leadership looking to coach and improve rep performance will find "immense benefit" from Revenue.io.

If you're scaling enablement or rolling out methodology, worth a 15-min look at real-time vs. post-call.

{Calendar link} or reply with a time.

```

### Step 3: Discovery Call
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How do you coach reps today—in real time or only after the call?
2. When a rep hits an objection on a call, do they get any live support—or figure it out later?
3. How long does it take a new rep to reach full productivity—and what would cutting that in half mean?
4. Do you have visibility into which reps follow methodology and which need help—at scale?
5. Are you using Gong or similar? Do they offer live in-call guidance or only post-call insights?

**Key Points to Cover**:
- Moments = live guidance during the call (differentiator)
- Rep Coaching = AI scorecards, feedback on every call; measure impact in Salesforce
- 60% ramp reduction; NFI, OrthoFX, HireRight proof

### Step 4: Demo
**Demo Flow**:
1. Moments: real-time in-call guidance (objections, cues, next steps)
2. Rep Coaching: scorecards, AI feedback, performance analytics
3. Conversation AI: summaries, "Ask about a conversation"
4. All in Salesforce; enablement can measure impact

**Features to Highlight**:
- Live prompts during the call (Moments)—not just after
- Scorecards on every call; methodology alignment
- 60% ramp reduction (site proof); OrthoFX 60% productivity

### Step 5: Proposal & Close

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We already have Gong" | "Gong is strong on post-call insights. Do your reps get live guidance during the call? Moments is the difference—coach when it matters." |
| "Reps don't want someone listening" | "Moments isn't surveillance—it's AI giving live prompts so they don't miss a cue. Reps who have it don't want to sell without it." |
| "We don't need in-call coaching" | "Post-call is helpful but the moment is gone. Ask: have you ever lost a deal because a rep fumbled an objection on the call? Moments prevents that." |
| "Need to prove enablement impact" | "Rep Coaching and scorecards tie to Salesforce—measure impact, ramp time, and methodology adherence. 60% ramp reduction is our proof." |
