# Use Case: Improve Quota Attainment and Forecast Accuracy

## Overview
Sales leaders need to hit quota consistently and improve forecast accuracy with real-time visibility into deal health, pipeline risk, and rep execution. Revenue.io delivers deal execution, sales forecasting, conversation intelligence, and rep coaching in one Salesforce-native platform—so leaders eliminate surprises and drive 120% quota attainment, 400% quota improvement (customer proof), and exceed quota across lines of business.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; any vertical with quota-carrying sales teams on Salesforce
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; multiple reps and lines of business
- **Characteristics**: Need predictable revenue; care about forecast accuracy and quota attainment; want real-time deal and rep visibility

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader (VP Sales, Director of Sales)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Account Executives (quota carriers), RevOps (forecast and data), Enablement (methodology)

### Trigger Event
- Missed quarter or inconsistent quota attainment; forecast inaccuracies; board or CFO pressure for predictability; need to see deal risk and rep execution in real time.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Forecasts are wrong; pipeline risks surface too late; quarter-end surprises
- No single view of deal health, next steps, and rep execution in Salesforce
- Quota attainment varies by team or rep; hard to scale winning behaviors
- Coaching is reactive; no real-time guidance to keep deals on track

### Desired State (After)
- Reliable forecast and consistent quota attainment (e.g. 120% quota attainment, 400% improvement)
- Real-time visibility into every opportunity—risk, health, next steps—in Salesforce
- Reps guided on next steps and methodology; coaching in the moment, not just after the call
- All lines of business able to exceed quota with one platform (Jan Dils example)

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Deal Execution, Sales Forecasting, Rep Coaching
- **Supporting**: Conversation AI (scorecards, summaries), Moments (real-time guidance), Revenue Platform
