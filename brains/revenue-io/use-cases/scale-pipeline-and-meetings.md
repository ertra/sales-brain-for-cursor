# Use Case: Scale Pipeline and Meetings

## Overview
Sales teams need to capture and convert more leads into pipeline and qualified meetings without proportionally adding headcount. Revenue.io delivers intelligent routing, instant response, the #1 Salesforce-native dialer, and guided engagement so teams book significantly more meetings (e.g. 10x monthly meetings, 400% more sales opportunities) while keeping or reducing tool complexity.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; technology, services, logistics, fintech, education—any vertical with inside sales or SDR motion
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; teams from ~10 to hundreds of reps
- **Characteristics**: Pipeline- and meeting-focused; run on Salesforce; want more conversations and meetings without adding reps

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Leader (VP Sales, Director of Sales, SDR/BDR Leader)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: SDR/BDR (daily users), RevOps (stack and data)

### Trigger Event
- Pipeline target increased but headcount flat or limited; need to prove more output per rep; current dialer or engagement tools aren't driving enough meetings or opportunities.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Meeting volume capped by manual dialing, slow follow-up, or disconnected tools
- Inbound leads not routed or responded to fast enough; hot leads go cold
- No single view of call outcomes and pipeline contribution; hard to scale what works
- Reps switch between phone, CRM, and engagement tools; activity doesn't log cleanly to Salesforce

### Desired State (After)
- Meaningfully more meetings and sales opportunities with same or fewer reps (e.g. 10x meetings, 400% more opportunities)
- Instant or near-instant lead response; every call and meeting tied to pipeline in Salesforce
- One platform for dialer, engagement, and intelligence; clear visibility into what's working
- Reps focused on conversations; automatic logging and guided next steps

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Salesforce Dialer (RingDNA), Lead Response (Hot Leads), Guided Selling / Sales Engagement
- **Supporting**: CallerDNA (tracking, routing, attribution), Conversation AI, Moments (real-time guidance)

### Solution Overview
Use the #1 Salesforce-native dialer with automatic logging and optional Dynamic Local Presence for global teams. Route and respond to inbound leads instantly (Hot Leads, call routing). Run guided cadences and follow-up so every touchpoint is tracked and tied to pipeline. Use real-time guidance (Moments) so reps convert more conversations into meetings. All activity and outcomes flow into Salesforce for full visibility.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Revenue.io platform (dialer, routing, engagement) on top of Salesforce; connect telephony and email
2. Configure lead routing and Hot Leads for instant response; set up call tracking and attribution
3. Build cadences and guided workflows for outbound and follow-up; enable real-time guidance (Moments) for reps
4. Review call analytics and pipeline contribution; refine plays and double down on what works
