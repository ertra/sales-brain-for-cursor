# Use Case: Respond to Leads Instantly (Lead Response Time)

## Overview
Marketing and sales need to connect with high-intent leads the moment they're ready—across phone, form, and channel—so hot leads don't go cold and conversion stays high. Revenue.io delivers instant lead response (Hot Leads), call tracking and routing, and campaign attribution so every inbound touch is captured, routed, and tied to revenue in Salesforce. Proof: time to first call cut from 48 hours to 3.5 minutes (Vagaro); 70% conversion boost; 100% of inbound leads captured and logged (RE/MAX).

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B or B2C with inbound leads; high-consideration or high-intent (e.g. legal, real estate, SaaS, services)
- **Size**: SMB to mid-market; marketing and sales need to work together on lead response
- **Characteristics**: Inbound phone and form volume; care about speed-to-lead and attribution; use Salesforce or want full-funnel visibility

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Marketer (Demand Gen, Marketing Ops), Sales Leader (Inside Sales, SDR lead)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: SDRs (receivers of leads), RevOps (attribution and routing)

### Trigger Event
- Hot leads going cold; slow or manual routing; can't attribute campaigns to pipeline; marketing and sales misaligned on lead handling.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- First touch takes hours or days; competitors get there first
- Inbound calls and form fills not captured or routed consistently; no single view in Salesforce
- Marketing can't tie campaigns to pipeline or revenue; attribution is guesswork
- Agents or reps can't prioritize high-priority leads or get context before the call

### Desired State (After)
- Instant or near-instant response (e.g. 48 hours → 3.5 minutes)
- 100% of inbound leads captured and logged in Salesforce; right rep gets the lead with context
- Campaign attribution: which campaigns drive calls and pipeline; full-funnel visibility
- Higher conversion and quota attainment from speed and prioritization

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Lead Response (Hot Leads), CallerDNA (call tracking, routing, attribution)
- **Supporting**: Salesforce Dialer, Guided Selling (follow-up), Revenue Platform (visibility in Salesforce)

### Solution Overview
Use Hot Leads and call routing so every high-intent lead gets instant connection to the right rep. Use CallerDNA and call tracking to capture every inbound call, attribute to campaigns, and log to Salesforce. Use the Revenue.io dialer and engagement so reps have context and can follow up in cadence. Marketing and sales see full-funnel results in one platform.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Revenue.io (call tracking, routing, dialer); connect to Salesforce and marketing sources
2. Configure lead routing rules and Hot Leads for instant assignment; set up campaign tracking and attribution
3. Train reps on lead context and follow-up; enable real-time guidance (Moments) for conversion
4. Review conversion and attribution in Salesforce; optimize campaigns and routing
