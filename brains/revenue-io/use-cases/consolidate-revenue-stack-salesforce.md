# Use Case: Consolidate Revenue Stack on Salesforce

## Overview
Revenue and sales teams run multiple tools for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, and forecasting—leading to disconnected data, duplicate effort, and high cost. Revenue.io delivers one Salesforce-native platform that unifies dialing, engagement, conversation AI, real-time guidance, rep coaching, and forecasting so RevOps and sales leaders consolidate the stack, keep Salesforce clean, and get one source of truth. Proof: Fundera "first sales system unequivocally happy with"; OrthoFX unified fragmented tools and boosted productivity 60%; Nutanix, HPE, NFI run entire GTM on Revenue.io.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; any vertical running sales on Salesforce
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; multiple vendors for dialer, engagement, or conversation AI
- **Characteristics**: Want to reduce vendor count and integration burden; care about data quality and automatic capture in Salesforce

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Operations (RevOps), Sales Leader
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales reps (users), IT/Security (compliance)

### Trigger Event
- Contract renewals for dialer, engagement, or conversation intelligence; Salesforce data quality issues; desire to simplify stack and reduce cost.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Multiple vendors: separate dialer, engagement, conversation AI, sometimes forecasting
- Data doesn't sync cleanly to Salesforce; duplicate or incomplete records; manual logging
- Reps jump between tools; adoption and visibility suffer
- High TCO: multiple contracts, integrations, and support

### Desired State (After)
- One platform for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, real-time guidance, and forecasting
- Automatic capture of every activity and outcome in Salesforce; clean objects and full visibility
- Single contract and integration; enterprise compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.) in one place
- Reps and leaders work in one system; no data loss between tools

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Revenue Platform (Revenue AI)—unified platform
- **Supporting**: Salesforce Dialer, Guided Selling, Conversation AI, Moments, Rep Coaching, Sales Forecasting, CallerDNA, Lead Response

### Solution Overview

All activity and outcomes flow automatically into Salesforce. One vendor for security, compliance, and support.

### Implementation Steps
