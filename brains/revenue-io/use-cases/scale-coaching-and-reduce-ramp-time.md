# Use Case: Scale AI Sales Coaching and Reduce Rep Ramp Time

## Overview
Enablement and sales leaders need to scale coaching so every rep gets consistent, methodology-aligned feedback—and new reps reach productivity faster. Revenue.io delivers AI-driven rep coaching, conversation scorecards, and real-time in-call guidance (Moments) so teams scale winning behaviors and shorten ramp. Proof: 60% reduction in rep ramp time (site); 60% productivity boost (OrthoFX); customers cite "immense benefit" for coaching and rep performance.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: B2B; any vertical with inside sales, SDR, or AE teams
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; growing teams and new hires
- **Characteristics**: Care about rep quality and consistency; want to measure enablement impact; need faster time to productivity

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Enablement (VP/Director Enablement, Sales Training), Sales Leader
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales reps (beneficiaries), Sales Manager (coaching consumer)

### Trigger Event
- New rep ramp too slow; coaching doesn't scale; methodology rollout needs reinforcement in the field; leadership wants measurable enablement impact.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Managers can't listen to every call; coaching is manual and post-hoc
- New reps take too long to reach quota; inconsistent application of playbooks
- No way to measure training impact or tie coaching to pipeline and performance
- Feedback comes after the call when the moment is lost

### Desired State (After)
- Every rep gets AI-driven feedback and scorecards on every call; real-time guidance during the call (Moments)
- 60% reduction in rep ramp time; new hires productive faster
- Measurable impact: scorecards and performance trends in Salesforce
- Methodology reinforced in the moment, not just in training sessions

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Rep Coaching, Moments (real-time guidance), Conversation AI (scorecards, summaries)
- **Supporting**: Guided Selling (guided actions), Revenue Platform (all data in Salesforce)

### Solution Overview
Use Rep Coaching for AI-driven feedback and conversation scorecards aligned to methodology. Use Moments for live in-call guidance so reps get prompts and coaching when it matters. Use Conversation AI for call summaries and scorecards so every call is evaluated and coachable. All insights and trends in Salesforce so enablement can measure impact and prioritize training.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Revenue.io (dialer, conversation AI, Moments, Rep Coaching); connect to Salesforce
2. Define scorecard criteria and methodology alignment; enable real-time guidance (Moments) for key scenarios
3. Train managers and enablement on scorecards and coaching suite; roll out to reps
4. Review performance analytics and ramp metrics in Salesforce; iterate on coaching and content
