# Case Study: FreshBooks

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | FreshBooks |
| **Industry** | SaaS / cloud accounting software for small business |
| **Company Size** | #1 cloud-based accounting for service-based SMB; 10M+ users; 120 countries |
| **Products Used** | RingDNA (Global Communications Hub), Local Presence, Call Metrics for Salesforce |
| **Primary Persona** | Sales Leader (Director of Sales) |
| **Use Case** | Fast rep onboarding; more and better sales conversations; manager visibility and transparency |

## Executive Summary
FreshBooks, the #1 cloud-based accounting software for service-based small business owners (10M+ users, 120 countries), needed to get reps up and running on a new system ASAP, improve the number and quality of sales conversations each day, and create a culture of transparency with real-time insight into rep activities and outcomes. They ran side-by-side pilots comparing Revenue.io and InsideSales.com. Revenue.io offered faster onboarding, easier implementation, and better Salesforce integration. Six months after choosing Revenue.io (RingDNA Global Communications Hub with Local Presence and Salesforce-integrated call metrics), FreshBooks saw instant rep onboarding with no custom Salesforce implementation, reps going from 30–40 outbound calls per day to **90–100 calls per day**, and call pickup rates improving from **11% to 21%**. The company expanded Revenue.io International Local Presence to the UK and Australia. Director of Sales called Revenue.io "our best sales productivity investment this year."
