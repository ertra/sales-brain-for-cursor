# Case Study: OrthoFX

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | OrthoFX |
| **Industry** | Healthcare technology / clear aligners |
| **Company Size** | Fast-growing; small startup (at time of story) |
| **Products Used** | Revenue.io Platform, RingDNA (Global Communications Hub), Performance Analytics |
| **Primary Persona** | RevOps / BI (Sr. Manager of Business Intelligence); Customer Success (Director of Customer Success) |
| **Use Case** | Unify fragmented tools; high inbound lead volume; leadership visibility; maximize Salesforce ROI; eliminate manual data entry |

## Executive Summary
OrthoFX, a fast-growing healthcare technology company (clear aligners; former Invisalign and Philips Sonicare execs), had multiple disparate tools that weren’t tightly integrated, causing inefficiencies. They were moving to Salesforce as their one-stop-shop CRM and wanted one seamless tool on top of Salesforce. They had high inbound lead volume from multiple online channels (Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) and needed streamlined lead management, prioritization (hot/warm/cold), and real-time visibility into metrics (case volume, doctors onboarded, call volume, patient conversions, channel performance). Revenue.io was the only platform that met their requirements of being seamlessly integrated and native to Salesforce. With the Revenue.io Platform, RingDNA, and Performance Analytics, OrthoFX consolidated fragmented tools, streamlined operations in Salesforce, and eliminated manual data entry. Results: **60% productivity increase** (no context switching or manual activity entry); **20%+ month-over-month patient conversions**; **60% increase in outbound activity**; 100% of activities (Tasks, Notes) logged automatically; management has real-time visibility for coaching and leading indicators.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Healthcare technology; clear aligners; orthodontics
- **Size**: Fast-growing; small startup; hyper-growth
- **Location**: (Not specified)
- **Business Model**: B2B and B2C; consumers (patients) and businesses (doctor offices); online sales + local doctor care

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Multiple disparate software tools were not tightly integrated, creating costly inefficiencies. The business had multiple tools for sales, support, and other operations—a fragmented technology stack. They were switching to Salesforce as their one-stop-shop CRM and wanted one seamless tool on top of Salesforce to maximize that investment. During discovery, OrthoFX found that Revenue.io was the only platform that met their requirements of being seamlessly integrated and native to Salesforce. High volume of inbound leads from multiple online channels (Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) created a need for streamlined lead management and prioritization (hot, warm, cold). They have sales and success reps working with both consumers (patients) and businesses (doctor offices). Management needed visibility into team activity to scale best practices. As a hyper-growth healthcare tech company, they needed to track defined metrics and tweak KPIs in real time (case volume, doctors onboarded, call volume, patient conversions, call duration, channel performance—calls vs. email vs. text).

### Key Pain Points
- Fragmented technology stack; multiple tools for sales and support; not tightly integrated
- Need one seamless, Salesforce-native tool on top of CRM
- High inbound lead volume; need lead management and prioritization
- Management needs real-time visibility into activity and metrics
- Need to track and optimize KPIs for rapid growth (case volume, conversions, channel performance)
- Manual data entry; no 360° view of customer

### Business Impact
- Costly inefficiencies; inability to scale best practices; incomplete view of customer and performance.
