## Executive Summary
Nutanix, a global leader in cloud software and hyperconverged infrastructure, faced a huge influx of sales leads and needed AEs and SDRs to follow up swiftly while tracking all activities. They needed automation from first-touch to opportunity to close, global local presence for a distributed sales force, and a complete system of record in Salesforce with 360° prospect view. Revenue.io delivered the RingDNA Global Communications Hub with Click-to-Dial, Voicemail Drop, Global Local Presence, and Sales Coaching. Results: at least two hours saved per rep per day; streamlined lead follow-up; better customer and manager experience; live call coaching and monitoring from anywhere. Nutanix is expanding to Revenue.io Conversation AI to ramp new reps faster and enable managers to coach smarter.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Cloud software; hyperconverged infrastructure; Enterprise Cloud OS
- **Size**: 2x unicorn; global leader; recent growth = influx of opportunities and leads
- **Location**: Global
- **Business Model**: B2B; software and infrastructure for IT

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
With a huge influx of sales leads, it became increasingly challenging for AEs and SDRs to follow up swiftly and track all associated activities. They needed to automate how they addressed and followed up on leads and streamline the process end-to-end from first-touch to opportunity creation to close. With a globally distributed sales force, Nutanix needed reps to localize selling motions domestically and internationally. Productivity was less than optimal; they needed to automate both outbound and inbound sales to maximize dials per day. To maintain a complete system of record in Salesforce and get a 360° view of the prospect, they needed automated call logging, call notes, call dispositions, and follow-up tasks. Marketing’s massive reach created a strong need for routing inbound calls to the right person at the right time.

### Key Pain Points
- Follow up on leads swiftly and track all activities
- Automate first-touch to opportunity to close
- Global local presence for domestic and international selling
- Maximize dials per day; automate outbound and inbound
- Complete system of record in Salesforce; 360° prospect view
- Automate call logging, notes, dispositions, follow-up tasks
- Route inbound calls to the right person at the right time

- Without automation and visibility, lead follow-up and rep productivity were constrained; scaling was hard.
