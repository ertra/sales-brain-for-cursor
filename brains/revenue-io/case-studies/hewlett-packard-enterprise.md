# Case Study: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) |
| **Industry** | Technology / Hybrid IT, servers, software, enterprise services |
| **Company Size** | Global enterprise; 150+ countries |
| **Products Used** | RingDNA (Global Communications Hub), Dynamic Local Presence Dialing, Call Analytics, Sales Coaching Suite, Conferencing |
| **Primary Persona** | Sales Leader / RevOps (Director of Worldwide Inside Sales Processes) |
| **Use Case** | Scale global inside sales; automate logging; real-time visibility; sales coaching |

## Executive Summary
HPE, a global enterprise selling into more than 150 countries after the HP split, needed to boost rep productivity, drive more sales conversations, automate Salesforce activity logging, and increase user adoption. They piloted Revenue.io in Prague, then rolled out to nine additional locations (Spain, US, Canada, UK). With Revenue.io Global Communications Hub, Dynamic Local Presence, Call Analytics, and Sales Coaching Suite—integrated with Salesforce and Microsoft Lync/Skype—HPE achieved 400% more sales opportunities, 400% increase in call pickup rates, 100% insight into call performance, and 100% user adoption across worldwide sales teams. Sales managers rely on the Call Coaching Suite for live and recorded monitoring and coaching.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Technology; hybrid IT, software-defined infrastructure, cloud, edge, services
- **Size**: Global enterprise; inside sales across 150+ countries
- **Location**: Worldwide (Prague pilot; then Spain, US, Canada, UK, and more)
- **Business Model**: B2B; servers, software, enterprise services

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
After the 2015 HP split, HPE needed to equip global inside sales with best-in-class technology. Rep productivity was suboptimal; they needed more quality sales conversations, full visibility into call analytics worldwide, and automated activity logging in Salesforce. They also needed to increase Salesforce adoption and ensure the solution worked within a complex, highly customized Salesforce org. Global operations (including eastern European markets) required dynamic country-to-country local presence dialing and enterprise-grade security for data from reps in disparate regions.

### Key Pain Points
- Boost rep productivity across a global sales team
- Drive more sales conversations
- Automate activity logging in Salesforce
- Real-time visibility into call activity and outcomes
- Management visibility and improved sales coaching
- Increase sales user adoption in Salesforce
- Complex, customized Salesforce; need flexible solution
- Global dialing (150+ countries) with local presence; enterprise security

### Business Impact
- Without a unified platform, reps and managers lacked visibility and consistency; adoption and productivity were limited.

### What They Tried Before
- Evaluated several competing solutions; Dana Clark (Director of Worldwide Inside Sales Processes) led evaluation with clear objectives: rep productivity, more conversations, call analytics, Salesforce adoption, flexibility for custom Salesforce, dynamic local presence for global dialing, enterprise security.
