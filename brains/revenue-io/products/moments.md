# Moments (Real-Time Guidance)

## Company
Revenue.io

## Overview
Real-time AI guidance during calls to coach reps and improve outcomes. Deliver live, in-call guidance powered by AI that helps every rep handle objections, follow cues, and close with confidence. Differentiator: guidance in the moment, not just after the call.

## Main Features
- **Live in-call guidance**: Coaching and prompts during the call, not only in post-call reviews.
- **Objection handling**: AI surfaces suggested responses and cues for objections in real time.
- **Methodology reinforcement**: Keeps reps aligned to playbooks and best practices as they sell.
- **RingDNA & CAI Live**: Live call coaching and monitoring to improve conversations as they happen.

## Problem Solved
Coaching happens after the fact; reps miss cues and repeat mistakes. By the time managers listen to recordings, the deal may be lost.

## Value Proposition
"Deliver live, in-call guidance powered by AI that helps every rep handle objections, follow cues, and close with confidence." Moments turns every rep toward best-rep behavior in the moment.

## Target Customers
Sales reps (SDRs, AEs) and managers who want real-time support during calls; enablement and leadership who want to scale live coaching.
