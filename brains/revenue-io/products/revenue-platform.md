# Revenue Platform (Revenue AI)

## Company
Revenue.io

## Overview
The unified Salesforce-native revenue orchestration platform that powers every stage of the sales process. Revenue.io delivers dialing, guided selling, conversation intelligence, real-time coaching, and revenue orchestration in one place—from first call to closed-won. It listens to sales calls, tracks deal activity, and guides reps on next actions in real time without jumping between tools.

## Main Features
- **Single platform**: One Salesforce-native system for engage, coach, and optimize; no more broken data or hoping reps follow through.
- **AI throughout**: AI agents, conversation summaries, opportunity summaries, scorecards, follow-up email, deal health, forecast analyzer, revenue intelligence.
- **Ask Revenue AI**: Query anything about a conversation, opportunity, or account to surface objections, risks, and next steps.
- **Integrations**: Built on Salesforce; enterprise CTI, call recording, transcripts, activity attribution.

## Problem Solved
Most tools show insights OR give actions—rarely both, and never fast enough. Teams waste time switching tools, fixing data, and chasing rep follow-through. Revenue.io unifies execution and intelligence in real time.

## Value Proposition
"Orchestrate your entire revenue process." The only Salesforce-native platform that combines real-time call intelligence, deal tracking, and rep guidance in one place. Proof: Nutanix, HPE, NFI Industries (10x meetings, 400% more opportunities); AppExchange 4.9, Gartner 4.8, G2 4.7.

## Target Customers
Revenue teams running on Salesforce; sales leadership, AEs, SDRs, RevOps, enablement, and marketing who want one platform for execution and intelligence.
