## Company
Revenue.io

## Overview
Call tracking, routing, and attribution that connects activities to revenue impact. Part of Revenue.io’s call intelligence capabilities: track every inbound and outbound call, route to the right rep or team, and attribute meetings and calls to opportunities for clear pipeline and revenue visibility.

## Main Features
- **Call tracking**: Track every inbound and outbound call and connect activity with outcomes.
- **Call routing**: Intelligent routing so every call reaches the right rep or team.
- **Campaign tracking**: Attribute inbound calls to campaigns and measure marketing impact.
- **Activity attribution**: Automatically link meetings to the right opportunities for clear visibility into deals, pipeline, and revenue.

## Problem Solved
Inbound and outbound calls aren’t tied to campaigns or opportunities; marketing and sales can’t see which activities drive revenue.

"Call tracking, routing, and attribution that connects activities to revenue impact." CallerDNA gives revenue and marketing teams full visibility into which calls and campaigns drive pipeline and revenue.

## Target Customers
