# Revenue Operations - Pain Points

## Overview
RevOps struggles with disconnected tools, data loss and incomplete Salesforce records, manual logging and workflow, and multiple vendors to integrate and maintain. They can't tie calls and meetings to pipeline and revenue cleanly. They want one Salesforce-native platform, automatic capture, and consolidation.

## Pain Points

### 1. Disconnected tools and broken Salesforce data
- **Description**: Dialer, engagement, and conversation tools don't sync cleanly to Salesforce. Records are duplicate, incomplete, or missing. Reps don't update CRM consistently.
- **Impact**: Unreliable reporting and forecasting; no single source of truth; RevOps spends time fixing data instead of enabling growth.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual cleanup, custom integrations, or accepting bad data.
- **Frequency**: Daily / Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Platform (Salesforce-native), automatic logging, activity attribution
- **Key Message**: "Keep Salesforce clean and complete by automatically capturing every activity and outcome—one platform, no data loss."

### 2. Multiple vendors to integrate and maintain
- **Description**: Separate contracts for dialer, engagement, conversation AI, forecasting. Each has its own integration, security review, and renewal. TCO and complexity add up.
- **Impact**: Higher cost; more integration failures; longer implementation; RevOps becomes integration janitor.
- **Current Solutions**: Accept multiple vendors, build middleware, or limit tool adoption.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / Quarterly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Platform (one platform for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, forecasting)
- **Key Message**: "Consolidate your stack. One Salesforce-native platform for the entire revenue team—automate workflows and unify GTM data."

### 3. No clear activity-to-revenue attribution
- **Description**: Can't tie calls and meetings to opportunities and revenue. Marketing and sales can't see which activities drive pipeline; reporting is incomplete.
- **Impact**: Can't optimize; can't prove ROI of campaigns or rep activity; attribution gaps in Salesforce.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual tagging, spreadsheets, or no attribution.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: CallerDNA, Lead Response, activity attribution (meetings linked to opportunities)
- **Key Message**: "Connect every call and meeting to pipeline and revenue. Clear visibility into deals, pipeline, and revenue performance in Salesforce."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Disconnected tools / broken data | High | Daily/Weekly | Revenue Platform, automatic capture | Salesforce-native; automatic logging; clean objects |

| No activity attribution | Medium–High | Weekly/Monthly | CallerDNA, Lead Response, attribution | Meetings and calls linked to opportunities; full visibility |

## Discovery Questions
1. How complete is your Salesforce activity data today—and how much of that is manual vs. automatic?
2. How many vendors do you have for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, and forecasting—and what's the total cost and integration burden?
3. Can you today tie every call and meeting to the right opportunity and see that in Salesforce?
4. What would it mean to have one platform that captures everything and keeps Salesforce clean without custom code?

## Trigger Events
- Salesforce data quality audit or leadership complaint
- Contract renewals for dialer, engagement, or conversation intelligence
- New RevOps lead wants to consolidate and automate
- Compliance or security review (need one vendor with SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)
