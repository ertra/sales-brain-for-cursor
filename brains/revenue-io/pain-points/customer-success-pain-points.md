# Customer Success - Pain Points

## Overview
Customer Success teams spend more time reacting to churn than identifying risk and expansion early. They lack a single view of account engagement, usage, and sentiment in real time; renewal risk and upsell potential surface too late. They want to see every customer signal before it's too late and prove value with data.

## Pain Points

### 1. Reacting to churn instead of preventing it
- **Description**: No early visibility into renewal risk, sentiment, or engagement drop-off. By the time they notice, the customer is already at risk or churned.
- **Impact**: Lost renewals; reactive firefighting; missed expansion; CS appears reactive, not strategic.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual health scores, spreadsheets, or gut feel; often too late.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / Quarterly (renewal cycles)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Account health from real activity (capture every call, email, meeting); early warnings (AI-driven signals, renewal risk, churn indicators)
- **Key Message**: "See every customer signal before it's too late. Early warnings built on real-time account insights—identify renewal risks and act before issues escalate."

### 2. No single view of account engagement and value
- **Description**: Customer interactions and usage are scattered. Can't see 360° view of engagement, sentiment, and outcomes in one place in Salesforce.
- **Impact**: Incomplete picture; can't run data-backed business reviews or prove value to execs.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual aggregation, multiple tools, or incomplete data.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue.io captures every call, email, meeting; syncs to Salesforce; tracks engagement trends, highlights at-risk accounts
- **Key Message**: "Account health built on real customer activity. See account engagement, usage signals, and sentiment in real time—all inside Salesforce."

### 3. Can't prove value or drive expansion systematically
- **Description**: Hard to connect usage to ROI and run expansion conversations with data. Success plans and business reviews lack evidence.
- **Impact**: Weaker renewals; missed expansion; CS can't demonstrate impact.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual decks, anecdotes, or no systematic value tracking.
- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Expansion opportunities (AI summaries, success plans, usage-to-ROI, insights for execs)
- **Key Message**: "Expansion opportunities built on proven success outcomes. AI summaries, mutual success plans, connect usage to ROI—accelerate renewals and growth."

## Discovery Questions
1. When do you typically find out a customer is at risk—and what would it mean to see that weeks or months earlier?
2. Do you have one place that shows every customer interaction and engagement trend for an account?
3. How do you today prove value and run expansion conversations—with data or mostly anecdotes?
4. What would it mean to have early warnings and expansion signals built on real activity in Salesforce?

## Trigger Events
- Unexpected churn or downgrade
- New CS leadership; focus on proactive health and expansion
- Renewal season; need to identify at-risk accounts early
- Board or CFO asking for retention and expansion metrics
