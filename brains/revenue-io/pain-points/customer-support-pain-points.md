# Customer Support - Pain Points

## Overview
Support leaders struggle with slow resolutions, inconsistent agent performance, high escalations, and repetitive work (logging, lookups). Agents don't have full context or real-time help during calls. They want to resolve issues faster, boost first-call resolution, and turn support into a growth engine for loyalty and retention.

## Pain Points

### 1. Slow resolutions; agents lack context
- **Description**: Agents struggle to access customer history and information quickly. They search during the call or transfer; customers repeat themselves and wait.
- **Impact**: Longer handle times; frustrated customers; lower satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Current Solutions**: Multiple systems, manual search, or hope the agent remembers.
- **Frequency**: Every call
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Real-time access to customer history, conversation summaries, knowledge base; 360° view of past interactions
- **Key Message**: "Resolve issues faster. Real-time access to customer history, summaries, and KB—so agents have full context on the first call."

### 2. Inconsistent performance; no real-time coaching
- **Description**: Without live coaching, agents deliver uneven service. Some follow best practices; others don't. Quality varies by agent and shift.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent customer experience; missed opportunities to upsell or retain; hard to scale quality.
- **Current Solutions**: Scripts, QA sampling, or post-call feedback that's too late.
- **Frequency**: Every call
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Moments (real-time in-call guidance), AI-driven prompts, live coaching
- **Key Message**: "Deliver consistent, high-quality support. Live coaching and AI-driven prompts during every call—so every agent follows best practices."

### 3. High escalations and repetitive work
- **Description**: Customers repeat concerns when transferred; recurring issues go unresolved. Agents waste time logging cases and searching for information instead of helping customers.
- **Impact**: Higher escalation rate; customer frustration; lower productivity.
- **Current Solutions**: More training, more tiers, or accept high escalation and manual work.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: 360° view (resolve on first call), automation (call logging, summaries, CRM updates)
- **Key Message**: "Boost first-call resolution and reduce escalations. Full context of past interactions so agents resolve on first contact—and automate logging so they focus on the customer."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Slow resolutions / no context | High | Every call | Real-time history, summaries, 360° view | Full context on first call; fewer repeat conversations |
| Inconsistent performance | Medium–High | Every call | Moments, live coaching | Real-time guidance during the call |
| High escalations / repetitive work | High | Daily | 360° view, automation | First-call resolution; automate logging and CRM updates |

## Discovery Questions
1. When a customer calls, how quickly can your agents get full context on past interactions—and do they often have to ask the customer to repeat?
2. Do your agents get any live guidance during the call—or only feedback after?
3. What's your first-call resolution rate—and how much time do agents spend on logging and lookups vs. helping customers?
4. What would it mean to give every agent a 360° view and live coaching on every call?

## Trigger Events
- Rising handle time or escalation rate
- Customer satisfaction or NPS below target
- New support leader; focus on consistency and first-call resolution
- Need to scale support without proportional headcount
