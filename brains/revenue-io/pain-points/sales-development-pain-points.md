# Sales Development - Pain Points

## Overview
SDRs/BDRs struggle with slow connection rates, manual follow-up and CRM updates, inconsistent cadences, and no in-call guidance. They can't scale meeting volume without proportional headcount. They want to connect with leads faster, automate follow-ups, and get real-time guidance so they book more meetings without the grind.

## Pain Points

### 1. Slow connection rates and manual dialing
- **Description**: Too much manual dialing and research; reps can't connect at scale. Dialer may not be Salesforce-native, so calls don't log or context is lost.
- **Impact**: Low meeting volume; reps burn out; can't hit activity targets without adding headcount.
- **Current Solutions**: More reps, generic dialers, or manual logging.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Salesforce Dialer (#1 Salesforce-native dialer), Lead Response (Hot Leads), Guided Selling
- **Key Message**: "Connect with leads faster. The #1 Salesforce-native dialer with automatic logging—NFI Industries saw 10x more monthly meetings."

### 2. Manual follow-up and CRM updates
- **Description**: Follow-ups and cadences are manual or inconsistent; Salesforce doesn't stay updated. Reps forget steps or duplicate work.
- **Impact**: Leads go cold; inconsistent experience; pipeline and reporting are wrong.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual sequences, spreadsheets, or partial automation that doesn't sync to Salesforce.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Guided Selling (cadences, email automation, calendar booking), Conversation AI (auto summaries and follow-ups)
- **Key Message**: "Automate follow-ups and keep Salesforce updated without manual work—guided cadences that boost response rates and conversion."

### 3. No in-call guidance; miss cues and best practices
- **Description**: Reps are on their own during calls. No live prompts for objections or next steps; they don't follow playbooks in the moment.
- **Impact**: Lower connect-to-meeting conversion; inconsistent messaging; hard to scale winning behaviors.
- **Current Solutions**: Scripts and hope; post-call coaching that's too late.
- **Frequency**: Every call
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Moments (real-time in-call guidance)
- **Key Message**: "Get live guidance on every call—handle objections and follow cues so you book more meetings with confidence."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Slow connection / manual dialing | High | Daily | Salesforce Dialer, Hot Leads | #1 Salesforce-native dialer; 10x meetings (NFI) |

| No in-call guidance | Medium–High | Every call | Moments | Real-time guidance during the call |

## Discovery Questions
1. How many dials and connects do your SDRs get per day—and how much of that is manual vs. powered by a dialer that logs to Salesforce?
2. When a lead doesn't answer, how do you ensure consistent follow-up and that Salesforce stays updated?
3. When an SDR is on a call and hits an objection, do they have any live help—or do they figure it out after?
4. What would 10x more meetings mean for your pipeline—and what's blocking you today?

## Trigger Events
- Need to scale meetings without adding headcount
- Dialer or engagement tool renewal; considering consolidation
- New SDR ramp; need them productive faster
- Leadership push for higher connection rates and pipeline
