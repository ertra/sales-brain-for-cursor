# Marketer - Pain Points

## Overview
Marketers struggle to connect campaigns to revenue; they can't attribute calls and leads to pipeline, and response to high-intent leads is often slow. They lack full-funnel visibility in Salesforce and work in silos from Sales. They want to tie campaigns to revenue, improve lead conversion, and align with Sales through visibility.

## Pain Points

### 1. Can't connect campaigns to revenue
- **Description**: No clear attribution for inbound calls and form fills to pipeline and revenue. Marketing can't see what happens after lead handoff or which campaigns drive deals.
- **Impact**: Can't optimize spend; can't prove marketing ROI; budget and strategy decisions are guesswork.
- **Current Solutions**: Last-touch attribution, spreadsheets, or no attribution.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / Quarterly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: CallerDNA (campaign tracking, call attribution), Lead Response, activity attribution in Salesforce
- **Key Message**: "Connect campaigns to revenue. Track every inbound call, tie campaign performance directly to revenue—full visibility in Salesforce."

### 2. Slow lead response; hot leads go cold
- **Description**: High-intent leads don't get a fast first touch. Routing and follow-up are manual or slow; competitors get there first.
- **Impact**: Lost pipeline; lower conversion; marketing spend wasted on cold leads.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual routing, round-robin, or hope sales follows up in time.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Lead Response (Hot Leads), call tracking and routing, Guided Selling (automation)
- **Key Message**: "Respond instantly to high-intent leads. Connect reps with buyers in real time—engage before competitors can."

### 3. No full-funnel visibility; marketing and sales siloed
- **Description**: Marketing can't see what happens after lead handoff in Salesforce. No shared view of pipeline, conversion, and revenue by campaign or source.
- **Impact**: Misalignment; duplicate effort; can't optimize funnel or prove impact.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual reports, separate tools, or no shared visibility.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Platform (full-funnel visibility in Salesforce), activity attribution
- **Key Message**: "Align with Sales through full-funnel visibility in Salesforce. Improve lead conversion and connect campaigns to revenue—one platform."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Can't connect campaigns to revenue | High | Monthly/Quarterly | CallerDNA, attribution | Call tracking, campaign attribution, pipeline visibility |

## Discovery Questions
1. When a high-intent lead comes in, how quickly do they get a first touch—and who decides which rep gets it?
2. Can you today tie inbound calls and form fills to specific campaigns and see pipeline/revenue impact in Salesforce?
3. Do you have visibility into what happens after lead handoff—conversion, pipeline, and revenue by source?
4. What would it mean to respond to every hot lead in minutes and attribute every call to revenue?

## Trigger Events
- Leadership asking for marketing ROI and attribution
- Lead volume up but conversion and speed-to-lead are weak
- New CMO or demand gen lead; focus on pipeline and alignment with Sales
- Campaign spend review; need to prove what drives revenue
