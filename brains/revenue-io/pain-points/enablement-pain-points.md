# Enablement - Pain Points

## Overview
Enablement leaders struggle to scale coaching and reinforce methodology; they can't measure training impact in Salesforce, and new reps ramp slowly. Coaching is often post-call only, so reps repeat mistakes before getting feedback. They want to scale coaching, tie enablement to outcomes, and reduce rep ramp time.

## Pain Points

### 1. Coaching doesn't scale
- **Description**: Managers can't listen to every call; feedback is manual and delayed. Reps don't get consistent coaching aligned to methodology.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent rep performance; methodology not applied in the field; enablement can't prove impact.
- **Current Solutions**: Sample call reviews, workshops, hope that reps self-correct.
- **Frequency**: Daily / Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Rep Coaching (AI-driven feedback, scorecards), Moments (real-time in-call guidance), Conversation AI
- **Key Message**: "Scale coaching with AI-driven feedback and scorecards on every call—and real-time guidance so reps get help when it matters."

### 2. Can't measure training impact
- **Description**: No clear link between enablement programs and pipeline, quota, or call quality. Data lives in separate tools or doesn't exist.
- **Impact**: Can't prove ROI of enablement; hard to prioritize what to teach; no trend visibility.
- **Current Solutions**: Surveys, anecdotes, or no measurement.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / Quarterly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Rep Coaching (performance analytics), Conversation AI (scorecards), Revenue Platform (all in Salesforce)
- **Key Message**: "Measure training impact directly in Salesforce—scorecards, performance analytics, and rep trends in one place."

### 3. New reps ramp too slowly
- **Description**: Long time to productivity; inconsistent application of playbooks and methodology. No real-time guardrails so new reps learn by mistake.
- **Impact**: Higher cost per rep; missed pipeline; turnover.
- **Current Solutions**: More training, shadowing, or accepting slow ramp.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (every new hire)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Moments (real-time guidance), Rep Coaching, Guided Selling; 60% reduction in rep ramp time (site proof)
- **Key Message**: "Shorten onboarding and speed time to quota. 60% reduction in rep ramp time with real-time coaching and guided selling."

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you today ensure every rep gets coaching—and how much of that is in real time vs. after the call?
2. Can you today tie enablement programs to rep performance and pipeline outcomes in Salesforce?
3. How long does it take a new rep to reach full productivity—and what would cutting that in half mean?
4. Do you have visibility into which reps follow methodology and which need help—at scale?
