# Account Executive - Pain Points

## Overview
AEs are under pressure to close deals faster and hit quota while drowning in manual work: logging calls, writing follow-ups, updating CRM. They lack full context (calls, emails, notes) in one place, get little or no in-call guidance, and struggle with unclear deal health and next steps. They want less admin, more selling, and real-time visibility in Salesforce.

## Pain Points

### 1. Manual work steals selling time
- **Description**: Logging calls, writing follow-up emails, updating CRM—reps spend hours on admin instead of conversations. Context is scattered across dialer, email, and CRM.
- **Impact**: Less time selling; slower follow-up; incomplete or stale Salesforce records; deals slip.
- **Current Solutions**: Do it manually, skip updates, or use multiple tools that don't sync well.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Conversation AI (auto summaries, follow-up emails), Salesforce Dialer (automatic logging), Deal Execution (CRM updates from activity)
- **Key Message**: "Eliminate manual work. Auto summaries, follow-ups, and CRM updates so you focus on closing—with complete context in one place."

### 2. No in-call guidance; inconsistent execution
- **Description**: Reps don't get live help during calls. They miss cues, fumble objections, and don't follow playbooks. Feedback comes only after the call.
- **Impact**: Lost deals; inconsistent messaging; reps can't replicate top performers.
- **Current Solutions**: Scripts, hope, or post-call coaching that's too late.
- **Frequency**: Every call
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Moments (real-time in-call guidance)
- **Key Message**: "Get live guidance during every call—handle objections, follow cues, and close with confidence when it matters."

### 3. Unclear deal health and next steps
- **Description**: Hard to know which deals are at risk, what's been said, and what to do next. Forecasting is guesswork; next steps are manual and inconsistent.
- **Impact**: Deals stall; wrong prioritization; missed follow-up; inaccurate commit.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual notes, spreadsheets, gut feel.
- **Frequency**: Daily / Weekly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Deal Execution (opportunity summaries, deal scorecards, "Ask about an opportunity"), Sales Forecasting
- **Key Message**: "See deal health, risks, and recommended next steps in real time—close deals faster with full visibility in Salesforce."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Manual work / admin | High | Daily | Conversation AI, Dialer, Deal Execution | Auto logging, summaries, follow-ups; Salesforce-native |
| No in-call guidance | High | Every call | Moments | Real-time guidance during the call, not just after |
| Unclear deal health / next steps | Medium–High | Daily/Weekly | Deal Execution, Sales Forecasting | Opportunity summaries, deal scorer, "Ask about an opportunity" |

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time do you spend after each call on notes, follow-up emails, and CRM updates?
2. When you're on a call and hit an objection, do you have any live support—or do you wing it and get feedback later?
3. How do you today know which deals are at risk and what the next best action is?
4. Do you have one place that shows every call, email, and note for a deal—or do you jump between tools?

## Trigger Events
- Missing quota or slipping deals
- New AE ramp; need to get them productive faster
- Leadership pushing for better forecast accuracy and rep productivity
- Switching CRMs or adding new tools (want less complexity)
