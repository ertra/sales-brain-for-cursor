# Sales Leader - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales leaders are under pressure to hit pipeline and revenue targets while controlling cost and complexity. They struggle with inconsistent rep performance, coaching that doesn't scale (post-hoc only), poor forecast accuracy, too many disconnected tools (dialer, engagement, conversation AI), and no real-time visibility into deal health and rep execution. They want one Salesforce-native platform and proof (quota attainment, rep productivity, ramp time).

## Pain Points

### 1. Coaching is post-hoc and doesn't scale
- **Description**: Managers can't listen to every call; feedback comes too late. Reps repeat mistakes and don't follow methodology. No real-time guidance during the moments that matter.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent rep performance; missed coaching opportunities; forecast risk; reps don't sell like the best rep.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual call reviews, separate conversation intelligence tools, hoping reps self-correct.
- **Frequency**: Daily / Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Rep Coaching, Moments (real-time in-call guidance), Conversation AI (scorecards, AI coaching feedback)
- **Key Message**: "Coach reps in real time—not just after the call. Every rep gets live guidance so they handle objections and follow methodology when it matters."

### 2. Poor forecast accuracy and pipeline visibility
- **Description**: Pipeline risks surface too late; no single view of deal health and next steps. Forecasts are guesswork; surprises at quarter end.
- **Impact**: Missed quarters; lost credibility with leadership; reactive firefighting instead of proactive course correction.
- **Current Solutions**: Spreadsheets, manual pipeline reviews, separate BI tools, gut feel.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Sales Forecasting, Deal Execution (opportunity summaries, deal health, forecast analyzer), Revenue Platform
- **Key Message**: "Improve forecast accuracy with real-time deal insights and AI-driven visibility into every opportunity in Salesforce. 120% quota attainment."

### 3. Too many tools with disconnected data
- **Description**: Separate dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and forecasting tools. Reps jump between apps; data is lost or duplicated in Salesforce. High cost and integration burden.
- **Impact**: Budget overrun; slow adoption; no single source of truth; leaders can't see full picture.
- **Current Solutions**: Accept multiple contracts, build integrations, or limit tool adoption.
- **Frequency**: Monthly / Quarterly (renewals, budgeting)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Revenue Platform (one Salesforce-native platform for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, forecasting)
- **Key Message**: "One platform to power your entire revenue team. No more jumping between tools—or losing data between them."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Post-hoc coaching / doesn't scale | High | Daily/Weekly | Rep Coaching, Moments, Conversation AI | Real-time in-call guidance (Moments); not just post-call insights |
| Poor forecast / pipeline visibility | High | Weekly/Quarterly | Sales Forecasting, Deal Execution | Real-time deal health and forecast analyzer in Salesforce |

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you today coach reps on calls—and how much of that happens in real time vs. after the fact?
2. When do you usually find out a deal is at risk—and what would it mean to see that earlier?
3. How many tools do you use for dialing, engagement, conversation intelligence, and forecasting—and is everything flowing into Salesforce cleanly?
4. What would it mean for your team if every rep had live guidance on every call?

## Trigger Events
- Missed quarterly pipeline or revenue target
- New sales leader wants to simplify stack and improve forecast accuracy
- Contract renewals for dialer, engagement, or conversation intelligence
- Rep turnover or ramp issues (need to scale coaching)
- Board or CFO asking for better forecast accuracy
