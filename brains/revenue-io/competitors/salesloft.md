| Feature | Revenue.io | Salesloft | Notes |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Salesforce-native only | ✅ Built for Salesforce | ⚠️ Multi-CRM | Revenue.io: one CRM, automatic capture |
| #1 Salesforce-native dialer | ✅ RingDNA in platform | ⚠️ Orchestrates/integrates | Revenue.io: dialer is core product, same platform as CI |
| Real-time in-call guidance | ✅ Moments | ⚠️ Conversations = insights/coaching | Revenue.io: live guidance during the call |
| Sales engagement | ✅ Guided Selling | ✅ Cadence | Both; Revenue.io native to dialer |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- Prospect is **Salesforce-only** and wants the **#1 Salesforce-native dialer** in the same platform as engagement and conversation AI—Revenue.io RingDNA + full platform
- **Real-time in-call coaching** is a priority—Revenue.io Moments; Salesloft strong on insights and coaching but not live in-call guidance as differentiator
- **Consolidation**: One Salesforce-native vendor for dialer, engagement, CI, and real-time guidance—Revenue.io built for that; HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings
- **Inside sales / dialer-centric**: Revenue.io #1 Salesforce dialer with automatic logging and real-time guidance in same product

### When They Win
- Prospect is **multi-CRM** or not standardizing on Salesforce
- Prospect wants **Drift (chat/website)** as primary lead source and is committed to Salesloft ecosystem
- Enterprise standardized on Salesloft for orchestration across multiple CRMs or tools

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **#1 Salesforce-native dialer in platform**: RingDNA is core product; every call in Salesforce and in Conversation AI; no "orchestrate a dialer"—dialer is native. HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings.
2. **Real-time in-call guidance (Moments)**: Live guidance during the call; Salesloft Conversations = powerful insights and coaching but not positioned as in-call live guidance like Moments.
3. **Salesforce-only**: Built only for Salesforce—deeper native sync, one data model, one vendor for full revenue orchestration on Salesforce.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Leading AI Revenue Orchestration Platform" | Strong platform; multi-CRM; dialer integrated | Revenue.io is the #1 Revenue Orchestration Platform for Salesforce with the #1 dialer built in—native, not just integrated |
| "Real-time data-driven AI insights" (Conversations) | Coaching and insights from activity and conversations | Revenue.io adds live in-call guidance (Moments)—reps get prompts during the call, not just after |
| "One platform" (Cadence, Deals, etc.) | Unified platform; orchestrates dialer/email/CRM | Revenue.io is one platform with the #1 Salesforce dialer as core—calls and engagement and CI in one native stack |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Salesloft
"Salesloft is a strong revenue orchestration platform. If you're on Salesforce and want the #1 Salesforce-native dialer and real-time in-call guidance in the same platform—so reps get live coaching during the call—Revenue.io is built for that. One platform: dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and Moments. HPE saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings."

### If Prospect is Evaluating Salesloft
1. Ask: "Do you want your dialer to be the same product as your conversation intelligence—native in one platform?"
2. Ask: "When a rep is on a call, do they get live guidance in the moment—or insights and coaching after?"
3. Position: Revenue.io for Salesforce-only teams that want #1 dialer + engagement + CI + live in-call guidance in one vendor.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Is the dialer you use today the same product as Salesloft, or a separate integration—and how does that affect data in Salesforce?"
2. "Does Salesloft give reps live prompts during the call for objections and next steps—or mainly post-call insights?"
3. "If you're 100% Salesforce, would having the #1 Salesforce dialer built into the same platform as engagement and CI simplify your stack?"
