# Competitor: Gong

## Overview
Gong positions as "The #1 AI operating system for Revenue Teams" and "Revenue AI OS"—focus on revenue graph, specialized AI agents, and purpose-built applications for prospecting through expansion. Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Revenue Action Orchestration; 5,000+ customers; strong in conversation intelligence, forecasting, and engagement (Gong Engage). CRM-agnostic; not Salesforce-native only. Revenue.io wins when the prospect is all-in on Salesforce and wants one platform that includes the #1 Salesforce-native dialer and real-time in-call guidance (Moments), not just post-call insights.

## Company Information

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Gong Engage | Sales engagement; prioritize and personalize; "send pipeline to the moon" | Revenue.io Guided Selling, Sales Engagement |
| Gong Forecast | Forecast accuracy, centralized analytics | Revenue.io Sales Forecasting, Deal Execution |
| Gong Agents | Automate follow-ups, pipeline edits, enablement, forecast | Revenue.io AI Agents |
| Gong Revenue Graph | Revenue data network, every interaction | Revenue.io Platform (conversation + deal data in Salesforce) |
| (Conversation intelligence) | Core heritage; call/meeting insights | Revenue.io Conversation AI |
| (Dialer) | Not a primary focus; integrate with others | Revenue.io = #1 Salesforce-native dialer built in |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "The #1 AI operating system for Revenue Teams" / "Gong Revenue AI OS"
- **Key Message**: Revenue graph + AI agents + apps; productivity, predictability, growth; "ring the gong, deal after deal"
- **Target Market**: Entire GTM; sales, marketing, RevOps; high-performing revenue teams; enterprise

## Strengths

## Weaknesses
- **Not Salesforce-native only**: Best for multi-CRM or non-Salesforce shops; Revenue.io is built only for Salesforce—deeper native integration, automatic logging, single platform
- **No built-in #1 Salesforce dialer**: Gong doesn't position as the dialer; Revenue.io has RingDNA (#1 Salesforce-native dialer) in the same product—calls and intelligence in one place
- **Real-time in-call guidance**: Gong emphasizes post-call insights and workflow; Revenue.io Moments = live guidance during the call (objections, cues, close)—differentiator for "coach when it matters"
- **Dialer + engagement + CI in one**: Prospect may need separate dialer + Gong; Revenue.io = dialer + engagement + conversation AI + real-time guidance in one Salesforce-native platform

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Revenue.io | Gong | Notes |
|---------|------------|------|-------|
| Salesforce-native only | ✅ Built for Salesforce | ⚠️ Multi-CRM | Revenue.io: one CRM, deeper native sync and logging |
| #1 Salesforce-native dialer | ✅ RingDNA in platform | ❌ Use separate dialer | Revenue.io: dialer + CI in one; no second vendor |
| Real-time in-call guidance | ✅ Moments | ⚠️ Post-call / workflow focus | Revenue.io: live guidance during the call |
| Conversation intelligence | ✅ Conversation AI | ✅ Core strength | Both strong; Revenue.io adds dialer + Moments |
| Sales engagement | ✅ Guided Selling | ✅ Gong Engage | Both; Revenue.io native to dialer and CI |
| Forecasting | ✅ Sales Forecasting | ✅ Gong Forecast | Both; Revenue.io tied to same platform as dialer |
| AI agents | ✅ AI Agents | ✅ Gong Agents | Both investing in AI |
| Single platform (dialer + engage + CI) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Dialer often separate | Revenue.io: one contract, one place for calls |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- Prospect is **Salesforce-only** and wants one vendor for dialer, engagement, and conversation AI—Revenue.io is built only for Salesforce
- **Real-time in-call coaching** is a priority—Revenue.io Moments delivers guidance during the call; Gong is strongest post-call
- Prospect wants **#1 Salesforce-native dialer** in the same platform as conversation AI—no separate dialer contract
- **Consolidation**: Replace dialer + Gong (or dialer + engagement + Gong) with one Revenue.io platform; HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings on one platform

### When They Win
- Prospect uses **multiple CRMs** or is not Salesforce-centric; Gong is CRM-agnostic
- Prospect already has a dialer they love and only wants conversation intelligence and revenue graph; Gong's strength is CI and data layer
- Enterprise standardized on Gong for revenue graph and AI agents with no interest in changing dialer or engagement

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Salesforce-native + #1 dialer**: One platform with the #1 Salesforce-native dialer (RingDNA); no separate dialer; every call automatically in Salesforce and in Conversation AI.
2. **Real-time in-call guidance (Moments)**: Coach reps during the call, not just after—handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence when it matters.
3. **One platform for GTM on Salesforce**: Dialer, engagement, conversation AI, real-time guidance, forecasting in one contract and one data model in Salesforce.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "#1 AI operating system for Revenue" | Strong in CI and revenue graph; dialer is not core | Revenue.io is the #1 Revenue Orchestration Platform for Salesforce with the #1 dialer built in—calls and intelligence in one place |
| "Power revenue from prospecting to expansion" | Multi-product; dialer often separate | Revenue.io powers every call and deal in one Salesforce-native platform; HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings |
| "Unify customer insights with Revenue Graph" | Valuable for multi-source data | Revenue.io unifies every call, deal, and activity in Salesforce with real-time guidance in the moment—not just post-call insights |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Gong
"Gong is strong in conversation intelligence and revenue graph. If you're all-in on Salesforce and want the #1 Salesforce-native dialer and real-time in-call guidance in the same platform—so reps get coaching during the call, not just after—Revenue.io is built for that. One platform: dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and Moments. HPE saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings."

### If Prospect is Evaluating Gong
1. Ask: "Do you need a dialer today—and do you want it in the same platform as your conversation intelligence?"
2. Ask: "How important is real-time guidance during the call vs. insights after the call?"
3. Position: Revenue.io for Salesforce-only teams that want one vendor for dialer + engagement + CI + live coaching.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "When a rep is on a call and hits an objection, does Gong give them live guidance during the call—or only insights afterward?"
2. "Is your dialer today part of Gong, or a separate tool—and how clean is the data flow into Salesforce?"
3. "If you're 100% Salesforce, would you prefer one platform that includes the dialer and conversation AI together, or multiple vendors?"
