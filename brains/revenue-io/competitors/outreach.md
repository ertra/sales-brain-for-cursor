# Competitor: Outreach

## Overview
Outreach positions as the "AI Revenue Workflow Platform" for sales, marketing, RevOps, and GTM—"the only end-to-end sales solution" to prospect, forecast, coach, close, renew, and expand. AI agents for every use case; workflow-first, results-driven. Key proof: Amplitude saved $600K+, consolidated five platforms to one; Siemens, Worldpay, Omniplex; over 2 million opportunities closed per month. CRM-agnostic; no native B2B data (customers use ZoomInfo, Apollo, etc.). Revenue.io wins when the prospect is Salesforce-only and wants one platform that includes the #1 Salesforce-native dialer, conversation intelligence, and real-time in-call guidance—no separate dialer or conversation-intelligence vendor.

- **Consolidation on Salesforce**: If prospect wants dialer + engagement + conversation AI in one Salesforce-native vendor, Revenue.io is purpose-built for that

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Revenue.io | Outreach | Notes |
|---------|------------|----------|-------|
| Salesforce-native only | ✅ Built for Salesforce | ⚠️ Multi-CRM | Revenue.io: one CRM, automatic capture in Salesforce |

| Conversation intelligence | ✅ Conversation AI | ⚠️ May integrate | Revenue.io: native recording, transcripts, scorecards |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- Prospect is **Salesforce-only** and wants **one platform** for dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence—Revenue.io is built only for Salesforce with dialer included
- **Real-time in-call coaching** matters—Revenue.io Moments; Outreach is workflow and post-call focused
- Prospect wants to **consolidate** dialer + Outreach (or dialer + engagement + CI) into one vendor—Revenue.io one platform; HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings
- **Inside sales / dialer-centric** motion—Revenue.io #1 Salesforce dialer with engagement and CI in same product

### When They Win
- Prospect is **multi-CRM** or not standardizing on Salesforce
- Prospect already has a dialer and only wants engagement and workflow; no consolidation goal
- Enterprise standardized on Outreach for AI workflows and deal/forecast with separate dialer strategy

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **#1 Salesforce-native dialer in the same platform**: No separate dialer; every call in Salesforce and in Conversation AI; HPE, NFI proof (400% more opportunities, 10x meetings).
2. **Real-time in-call guidance (Moments)**: Coach reps during the call; Outreach is workflow and post-call oriented.
3. **One Salesforce-native platform**: Dialer, engagement, conversation AI, real-time guidance, forecasting in one contract—built for Salesforce only.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Only end-to-end sales solution" | Strong on workflow and AI; dialer and full CI often separate | Revenue.io is the only Revenue Orchestration Platform that includes the #1 Salesforce dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and real-time guidance in one—for Salesforce teams |
| "Forecast, coach, close, renew, expand" | Strong capabilities; dialer/CI may be other vendors | Revenue.io does all of that on one Salesforce-native platform—including the dialer and live in-call coaching |
| "5 platforms to 1" (Amplitude) | Outreach consolidated their stack | Revenue.io consolidates dialer + engagement + conversation AI + guidance into one; no separate dialer or CI vendor |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Outreach
"Outreach is strong on AI workflows and engagement. If you're on Salesforce and want the #1 Salesforce-native dialer and conversation intelligence—including real-time guidance during the call—in the same platform, Revenue.io is built for that. One platform: dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and Moments. Customers like HPE saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings on one platform."

### If Prospect is Evaluating Outreach
1. Ask: "Do you need a dialer in the same platform as your engagement and conversation intelligence?"
2. Ask: "How important is real-time coaching during the call vs. workflow and post-call insights?"
3. Position: Revenue.io for Salesforce-only teams that want dialer + engagement + CI + live coaching in one vendor.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Is your dialer today part of Outreach or a separate tool—and how does call data get into Salesforce?"
2. "When a rep is on a call, do they get live guidance in the moment—or only insights and workflows after?"
3. "If you're all-in on Salesforce, would one platform that includes the dialer make adoption and data quality easier?"
