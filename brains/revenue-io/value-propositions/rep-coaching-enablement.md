# Rep Coaching → Enablement Value Proposition

## Summary
Revenue.io Rep Coaching and Moments give enablement leaders scalable, real-time coaching that reinforces methodology and measures impact in Salesforce. AI-driven feedback and scorecards on every call; live in-call guidance so reps get help when it matters. Proof: 60% reduction in rep ramp time; scale coaching without adding managers; measure training impact directly in Salesforce.

## The Problem
Enablement can't scale coaching—managers can't listen to every call, and feedback is post-hoc. New reps ramp slowly; there's no clear link between training and rep performance or pipeline. Methodology doesn't stick in the field because reinforcement happens too late.

## The Solution
Rep Coaching: AI-driven feedback, conversation scorecards, and performance analytics aligned to methodology. Moments: real-time in-call guidance so reps get coaching during the call. Together, enablement scales winning behaviors, shortens ramp (60% reduction), and measures impact with data in Salesforce.
