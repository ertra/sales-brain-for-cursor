# Lead Response → Marketer Value Proposition

## Summary
Revenue.io Lead Response (Hot Leads) and CallerDNA help marketers connect campaigns to revenue and respond to high-intent leads in real time. Track every inbound call, route to the right rep instantly, and attribute campaigns to pipeline and revenue in Salesforce. Full-funnel visibility and speed-to-lead so marketing and sales align on one platform.

## The Problem
Marketers can't tie campaigns to revenue; attribution is broken or missing. Hot leads don't get a fast first touch—routing is slow or manual, and competitors get there first. No full-funnel visibility in Salesforce, so marketing and sales work in silos.

## The Solution
Hot Leads: instant lead response engine that connects reps with buyers in real time. CallerDNA: call tracking, routing, and campaign attribution so every inbound call ties to campaigns and pipeline. All in Salesforce—marketing sees what happens after handoff and can optimize for revenue.
