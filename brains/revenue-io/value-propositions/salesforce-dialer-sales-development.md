# Salesforce Dialer → Sales Development Value Proposition

## Summary
The #1 Salesforce-native dialer lets SDRs call, connect, and convert faster with automatic logging and full context in Salesforce. No more switching apps or manual data entry—reps get speed and accuracy while leaders get real-time visibility. NFI Industries saw 10x more monthly meetings; HPE cited more dials, higher connection rates, and a market-leading platform.

## The Problem
SDRs lose time switching between phone and CRM; calls go unlogged or context is lost. Generic dialers don't sync cleanly with Salesforce, so pipeline and activity data are incomplete. Connection rates and meeting volume stay flat without adding headcount.

## The Solution
RingDNA Dialer (Revenue.io Salesforce Dialer): built for speed, accuracy, and call intelligence, with automatic logging and real-time visibility in Salesforce. SDRs stay in Salesforce; every call is captured, attributed, and available for conversation AI and real-time guidance (Moments).
