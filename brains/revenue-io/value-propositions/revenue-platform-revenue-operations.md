# Revenue Platform → Revenue Operations Value Proposition

## Summary
Revenue.io gives RevOps one Salesforce-native platform for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, real-time guidance, and forecasting—so they automate workflows, unify GTM data, and consolidate the stack. Automatic capture keeps Salesforce clean and complete; activity attribution ties every call and meeting to pipeline and revenue. Fewer vendors, one source of truth, enterprise compliance (HIPAA, TCPA, GDPR, SOC 2).

## The Problem
RevOps juggles multiple vendors (dialer, engagement, conversation AI); data is disconnected and Salesforce records are incomplete or duplicate. Reps don't update CRM consistently; there's no clean activity-to-revenue attribution. Integrations and renewals add cost and complexity.

## The Solution
One platform: all revenue workflows run on Revenue.io and sync natively to Salesforce. Automatic logging, activity attribution (meetings and calls linked to opportunities), and unified data. RevOps consolidate contracts, reduce integration burden, and keep Salesforce the single source of truth with enterprise-grade security and compliance.
