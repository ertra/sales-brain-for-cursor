# Revenue Platform → Sales Leader Value Proposition

## Summary
The Revenue.io platform gives sales leaders one Salesforce-native system for dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence, real-time guidance, and forecasting. Leaders get pipeline visibility, rep coaching at scale, and forecast accuracy without jumping between tools—with proof: 120% quota attainment, $300K increase in rep productivity, 60% reduction in rep ramp time. Nutanix, HPE, and NFI Industries run their entire GTM on Revenue.io.

## The Problem
Sales leaders lack a single view of pipeline and rep execution; coaching is post-hoc and doesn't scale. Multiple tools (dialer, engagement, conversation AI) mean disconnected data, high cost, and no real-time visibility into deal health or rep performance.

## The Solution
One platform: Salesforce Dialer, AI agents, sales engagement, conversation intelligence, real-time guidance (Moments), rep coaching, and sales forecasting—all in Salesforce. Leaders coach in real time, see every opportunity, and consolidate vendors while improving accuracy and productivity.
