# Moments (Real-Time Guidance) → Account Executive Value Proposition

## Summary
Moments gives account executives live, in-call guidance so they handle objections, follow cues, and close with confidence when it matters—not just in post-call reviews. AEs get real-time prompts and coaching during every call, so they replicate top-performer behavior and close more deals without the guesswork.

## The Problem
AEs don't get help during the call; feedback comes too late. They miss cues, fumble objections, and can't consistently follow playbooks. By the time managers listen to recordings, the deal may be lost.

## The Solution
Real-time AI guidance during the call: live prompts for objections, next steps, and methodology. Moments delivers "live, in-call guidance powered by AI that helps every rep handle objections, follow cues, and close with confidence." No extra app toggling—guidance in the moment, inside the Revenue.io platform.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Guidance when it matters—during the call
- **Benefit**: Reps get help in the moment, not hours or days later. Objections and next steps surface in real time.
- **Proof Point**: "Deliver live, in-call guidance powered by AI"; "only Salesforce-native platform that does it all in real time" (platform page).
- **Customer Quote**: (Use case: AEs closing with confidence; reinforce methodology in the moment.)

### 2. Consistent execution and methodology
- **Benefit**: Every rep follows the same playbooks and best practices during the call; reduce variance and replicate winners.
- **Proof Point**: Real-time guidance "reinforces methodology"; Rep Coaching + Moments together scale winning behaviors.
- **Customer Quote**: "Account Management is spending less time on administrative tasks and follow up and focusing more on the high-value aspects of the job." — Susan Hopper, VP Sales Enablement, HireRight

### 3. Close more with confidence
- **Benefit**: Less second-guessing; reps know what to say and do next. Handle objections and close with confidence.
- **Proof Point**: "Close deals faster with complete context from calls, emails, and CRM data in one place" (AE persona); Moments is differentiator vs. post-call-only tools.
- **Customer Quote**: (Positioning: AEs who have Moments close with confidence and full context.)
