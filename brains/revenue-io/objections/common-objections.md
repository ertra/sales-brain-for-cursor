# Common Objections (All Personas)

## Overview
Cross-persona objections and responses for Revenue.io, with proof points and follow-up questions. Use alongside persona-specific objection files (sales-leader, revenue-operations, account-executive).

## Objections

### 1. Salesforce-only: "We might move off Salesforce" / "We're multi-CRM"

**Why They Say This**: Future-proofing; other business units on different CRMs; or evaluating CRM strategy.

**Acknowledge**: "It's smart to think about where your revenue data will live long term."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io is built only for Salesforce so we can go deeper—automatic logging, one data model, and the #1 Salesforce-native dialer in the same platform as conversation AI and real-time guidance. If you're on Salesforce today and want one vendor for dialer, engagement, and coaching, we're the fit. If you're truly multi-CRM, we're not the right choice—but most revenue teams we work with are standardizing on Salesforce for revenue."

**Proof Point**:
- HPE (150+ countries), Nutanix, NFI, Fundera—all Salesforce; 400% more opportunities, 10x meetings
- One platform = one contract, one integration, clean Salesforce

**Follow-Up Question**: "Is Salesforce your system of record for revenue for the next 2–3 years? That's where we add the most value."

---

### 2. Price/Budget: "We don't have the budget" / "Revenue.io is too expensive"

**Why They Say This**: Value not clear; comparing to point solutions; or real budget constraint.

**Acknowledge**: "Budget is always a consideration."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io often reduces total spend by replacing multiple tools—dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence—with one platform. You get the #1 Salesforce-native dialer, conversation AI, and real-time in-call guidance in one contract. Customers like HPE and NFI run their entire GTM on Revenue.io; Fundera called it the first sales system they're unequivocally happy with. We can map your current dialer + engagement + CI spend to one Revenue.io plan and show payback."

**Proof Point**:
- One platform replaces dialer + engagement + CI; OrthoFX 60% productivity boost; consolidation (Fundera, Nutanix)
- See revenue.io/pricing; enterprise plans for scale

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are you spending today on dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence combined? We can compare that to one platform."

---

### 3. Timing: "Not the right time" / "Let's revisit next quarter"

**Why They Say This**: Other priorities; contract not up for renewal; or avoiding decision.

**Acknowledge**: "Timing matters."

**Respond**: "Every quarter without real-time coaching and one platform is another quarter of post-call-only insights and reps jumping between tools. HPE saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings—those came from making the move. If your dialer or engagement renewal is coming up, that's the ideal time to evaluate one platform. We can run a pilot or proof of value so you see impact before a full commitment."

**Proof Point**:
- 120% quota attainment; 60% reduction in rep ramp time—proof from current customers
- Pilot and demo available; no need to wait for renewal to start a conversation

**Follow-Up Question**: "When does your current dialer or engagement contract renew? We can align a pilot or comparison to that."

---

### 4. Competition: "We're looking at Gong / Outreach / Salesloft"

**Why They Say This**: Doing due diligence; existing relationship; or procurement list.

**Acknowledge**: "Those are strong options. It's smart to compare."

**Respond**: "Gong and Outreach are great at conversation intelligence and workflows—but they don't include the #1 Salesforce-native dialer in the same product, and they don't deliver real-time in-call guidance like our Moments. Revenue.io is built only for Salesforce: dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and live guidance during the call in one platform. If you're Salesforce-only and want one vendor so every call is logged and every rep gets coaching in the moment, we're the fit. HPE chose us for global inside sales and saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings."

**Proof Point**:
- Gong/Outreach/Salesloft: typically separate dialer; post-call focus. Revenue.io: #1 dialer + Moments (in-call) in one platform
- HPE 400% more opportunities; NFI 10x meetings; Fundera "first sales system unequivocally happy with"

**Follow-Up Question**: "Is your dialer today part of the same product as your conversation intelligence—and do reps get live guidance during the call or only after?"

---

### 5. Status Quo: "We're fine with what we have" / "Our current stack works"

**Why They Say This**: Change is hard; don't see the problem; or comfortable with current solution.

**Acknowledge**: "If it's working, that's valuable."

**Respond**: "Many teams think that until they see what they're missing—real-time in-call guidance so reps get help when it matters, not just after the call, and one platform so Salesforce stays clean and you're not juggling dialer, engagement, and CI. HPE was a global enterprise with a complex stack; they chose Revenue.io and saw 400% more opportunities and 100% user adoption. NFI saw 10x more meetings. The question isn't whether the current stack 'works'—it's whether you're leaving quota and ramp time on the table by not having live coaching and one platform."

**Proof Point**:
- 120% quota attainment; 60% ramp reduction; $300K rep productivity (site)
- HPE, NFI, Fundera moved from other setups to Revenue.io

**Follow-Up Question**: "When was the last time you measured rep ramp time and quota attainment—and do reps get any guidance during the call today?"

---

### 6. Authority: "I need to check with my boss / RevOps / IT"

**Why They Say This**: Genuine need for buy-in; or using as delay tactic.

**Acknowledge**: "Getting alignment makes sense."

**Respond**: "We can help you make the case. We have ROI proof—120% quota attainment, 60% ramp reduction, HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x meetings—and we can put together a one-pager or business case for your boss or RevOps. We also have enterprise security and compliance—SOC 2, HIPAA, TCPA, GDPR—so IT and security are covered. Would it help if we joined a call with your boss or RevOps to walk through the platform and ROI?"

**Proof Point**:
- Case studies (HPE, NFI, Fundera, OrthoFX); AppExchange 4.9, Gartner 4.8, G2 4.7
- Enterprise-grade security; one platform simplifies IT and RevOps

**Follow-Up Question**: "Who else is involved in the decision—and what would they need to see to get comfortable?"

---

### 7. Real-time guidance: "We don't need in-call coaching" / "Post-call is enough"

**Why They Say This**: Haven't seen Moments; or believe feedback after the call is sufficient.

**Acknowledge**: "Post-call insights are valuable."

**Respond**: "Post-call is helpful—but by then the moment is gone. Revenue.io Moments gives reps live guidance during the call: handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence when it matters. That's why we're different from Gong and others that focus on after-the-fact insights. Customers tell us that once reps have Moments, they don't want to sell without it. It's the difference between winging it and having a coach in your ear."

**Proof Point**:
- "Only Salesforce-native platform that does it all in real time" (platform page)
- Rep Coaching + Moments = scale winning behaviors; 60% ramp reduction

**Follow-Up Question**: "Have you ever had a deal slip because a rep missed a cue or fumbled an objection on the call? That's what Moments prevents."

---

### 8. Implementation: "We can't afford a long implementation"

**Why They Say This**: Past bad experiences; or need quick wins.

**Acknowledge**: "Implementation speed matters."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io is built on Salesforce—so there's no separate data layer to migrate. We connect to your existing Salesforce org; the dialer, engagement, and conversation AI flow into the same objects you already use. Customers like Fundera and OrthoFX streamlined workflows and saw results; HPE rolled out across multiple countries. We can outline a phased rollout so you get value quickly—for example dialer and logging first, then Moments and coaching."

**Proof Point**:
- Salesforce-native = no duplicate data model; automatic logging
- HPE 100% user adoption; OrthoFX 60% productivity; Fundera "unequivocally happy"

**Follow-Up Question**: "What's your timeline for going live—and what would 'quick win' look like for you?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "Is Salesforce your system of record for revenue—and for the next 2–3 years?"
2. "When does your current dialer or engagement contract renew?"
3. "Do reps get any live guidance during the call today—or only feedback after?"
4. "How many tools do you use today for dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence—and what's the combined cost?"
5. "Who's involved in the decision—sales, RevOps, IT, security?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're evaluating a new CRM" (Salesforce-only may not fit)
- "We're happy with our dialer" (need to show value of one platform + Moments)
- "We only need conversation intelligence" (Revenue.io sells platform; if they want CI only, Gong may be mentioned)
- Repeated "we need to check with X" without next steps (clarify process and timeline)
