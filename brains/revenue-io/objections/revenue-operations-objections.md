# Revenue Operations - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from RevOps (VP/Director/Manager of Revenue Operations, Sales Operations) when evaluating Revenue.io, with responses, proof points, and follow-up questions.

## Objections

### 1. "We have a dialer we're happy with—we only need engagement / conversation intelligence"

**Why They Say This**: Don't want to change dialer; or see Revenue.io as "another dialer."

**Acknowledge**: "If the dialer is working, that's valuable."

**Respond**: "The issue is usually data and consolidation. With a separate dialer, you're maintaining another integration and another data flow into Salesforce—and conversation intelligence often lives in yet another product. Revenue.io is one platform: the #1 Salesforce-native dialer, engagement, and conversation AI in the same product. That means one integration, one data model, automatic logging, and no sync gaps. RevOps at Fundera and OrthoFX consolidated and saw streamlined workflows and 60% productivity gains. If you're open to evaluating dialer and engagement and CI together, we can show how one platform keeps Salesforce clean and reduces your integration burden."

**Proof Point**:
- "Keep Salesforce clean and complete by automatically capturing every activity and outcome"
- Fundera streamlined workflows; OrthoFX 60% productivity, eliminated manual data entry
- One platform = one integration, one vendor

**Follow-Up Question**: "How many systems today touch Salesforce for calls and activities—and how much time do you spend on data quality and integrations?"

---

### 2. "Our Salesforce is heavily customized—will Revenue.io work?"

**Why They Say This**: Fear of integration issues; or past bad experiences with vendors.

**Acknowledge**: "Customization is important—you've built processes that work."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io is built for Salesforce and designed to work with standard and customized objects. HPE had a complex, highly customized Salesforce and needed a solution that was flexible enough to work within it—they also operate in 150+ countries with dynamic local presence. We integrated with Salesforce plus Microsoft Lync and Skype. We log activities to the objects you already use, so we're not forcing a new data model. We can do a technical review of your org and outline exactly how we'd connect and what would stay as-is."

**Proof Point**:
- HPE: "complex and highly customized Salesforce"; integrated with Lync/Skype; 150+ countries
- Salesforce-native = works with your objects and workflows

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are the main custom objects or flows that your dialer and engagement tools touch today? We can map Revenue.io to those."

---

### 3. "We're concerned about security and compliance"

**Why They Say This**: Enterprise requirement; or past audit findings.

**Acknowledge**: "Security and compliance are non-negotiable."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io is built for enterprise: SOC 2, HIPAA, TCPA, GDPR, CCPA, CPRA. We have role-based access, AI governance, and we're used by global enterprises like HPE and Nutanix. You get one vendor to audit and one set of controls for dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence. We can provide security documentation and connect you with our security team for a deeper review."

**Proof Point**:
- SOC 2, HIPAA, TCPA, GDPR, CCPA, CPRA; enterprise-grade (platform page)
- HPE, Nutanix—global, regulated environments

**Follow-Up Question**: "What certifications or controls does your security team require—and do you have a questionnaire we can complete?"

---

### 4. "We already have Gong / Outreach—adding Revenue.io would be redundant"

**Why They Say This**: See Revenue.io as "another conversation intelligence" or "another engagement" tool.

**Acknowledge**: "You've already invested in Gong or Outreach."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io isn't an add-on—it's a replacement that consolidates. If you have Gong or Outreach plus a separate dialer, you have two or three vendors, two or three integrations, and multiple data flows into Salesforce. Revenue.io is one Salesforce-native platform: dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and real-time in-call guidance. So the choice isn't 'add Revenue.io'—it's 'replace dialer + engagement + CI with one platform' and simplify your stack. RevOps at Fundera and OrthoFX consolidated and reduced complexity while improving outcomes."

**Proof Point**:
- One platform replaces dialer + engagement + CI; Fundera, OrthoFX, Nutanix
- "Automate workflows, unify GTM data, consolidate your stack" (solutions hub)

**Follow-Up Question**: "If you could have one vendor for dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence with one integration to Salesforce, would that simplify your stack?"

---

### 5. "Implementation would be too disruptive"

**Why They Say This**: Past bad implementations; or can't afford downtime.

**Acknowledge**: "Implementation risk is real."

**Respond**: "Because we're Salesforce-native, we're not migrating data from another CRM or building a new data layer—we're connecting to the Salesforce org you already have. Activities and outcomes flow into the same objects you use today. We can do a phased rollout—for example dialer and logging first, then engagement and Moments—so you get value quickly without a big-bang cutover. HPE rolled out across multiple countries; OrthoFX streamlined operations without a long implementation."

**Proof Point**:
- Salesforce-native = no separate data migration; automatic logging
- HPE multi-country rollout; OrthoFX streamlined; Fundera "unequivocally happy"

**Follow-Up Question**: "What's your timeline for a rollout—and would a phased approach (e.g. dialer first, then full platform) work for you?"

---

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "How many vendors today touch Salesforce for calls, activities, and engagement—and what's the total integration and support burden?"
2. "What security and compliance requirements do you have—SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.?"
3. "Is your dialer part of the same product as your engagement and conversation intelligence?"
4. "What would 'success' look like for RevOps in 6 months—fewer integrations, cleaner data, something else?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're moving to a different CRM" (we're Salesforce-only)
- "We're not allowed to change dialer" (need executive or business case to consolidate)
- No clear RevOps owner (identify who owns sales tech and data quality)

## Quick Reference

| Objection | Key Response | Proof Point |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Happy with dialer; only need engagement/CI | One platform = one integration, clean Salesforce; consolidate | Fundera, OrthoFX; automatic capture |
| Heavily customized Salesforce | Built for Salesforce; HPE had complex org; we map to your objects | HPE 150+ countries, Lync/Skype |
| Security and compliance | SOC 2, HIPAA, TCPA, GDPR, etc.; one vendor to audit | Enterprise; HPE, Nutanix |
| Gong/Outreach = redundant | Replace, don't add; one platform for dialer + engage + CI | Consolidation; Fundera, OrthoFX |
| Implementation too disruptive | Salesforce-native; phased rollout; no new data layer | HPE rollout; OrthoFX; phased approach |
