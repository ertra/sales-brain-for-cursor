# Sales Leader - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from Sales Leaders (VP Sales, Director of Sales, Sales Manager) when evaluating Revenue.io, with responses, proof points, and follow-up questions.

## Objections

### 1. "We already have Gong / Outreach for conversation intelligence"

**Why They Say This**: Sunk cost; existing relationship; or don't see need to add another vendor.

**Acknowledge**: "Gong and Outreach are strong. Many leaders use them for insights and workflows."

**Respond**: "The question is whether you have the #1 Salesforce-native dialer and real-time in-call guidance in the same platform. With Gong or Outreach, you typically have a separate dialer—so calls and intelligence live in different places. Revenue.io gives you the dialer, engagement, conversation AI, and Moments—live guidance during the call—in one Salesforce-native platform. HPE chose us for global inside sales and saw 400% more opportunities; NFI saw 10x more meetings. If you're Salesforce-only and want one vendor so every call is logged and every rep gets coaching in the moment, we're the fit."

**Proof Point**:
- HPE 400% more opportunities; NFI 10x meetings; 100% user adoption (HPE)
- One platform: dialer + engagement + CI + Moments

**Follow-Up Question**: "Is your dialer today part of the same product as your conversation intelligence—and do your reps get any live guidance during the call?"

---

### 2. Price/Budget: "We can't justify the cost right now"

**Why They Say This**: Value not clear; or real budget constraint; or comparing to single-tool cost.

**Acknowledge**: "Budget is always a consideration."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io often replaces multiple contracts—dialer, engagement, conversation intelligence—so total cost can go down while you get more: real-time in-call guidance, 120% quota attainment, 60% faster ramp. We can map what you're spending today on those tools to one Revenue.io plan. Customers like Fundera said Revenue.io is the first sales system they're unequivocally happy with; OrthoFX saw 60% productivity boost. The cost of inaction is another quarter of post-call-only coaching and reps jumping between tools."

**Proof Point**:
- 120% quota attainment; 60% ramp reduction; $300K rep productivity (site)
- One platform = one contract; consolidation (Fundera, Nutanix, OrthoFX)

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are you spending today on dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence—and who owns that budget?"

---

### 3. Timing: "Let's wait until next year" / "We're in the middle of a rollout"

**Why They Say This**: Other priorities; current rollout; or avoiding decision.

**Acknowledge**: "Timing is important."

**Respond**: "Every quarter you wait is another quarter without real-time coaching and one platform. HPE and NFI didn't wait—they saw 400% more opportunities and 10x more meetings. If you have a renewal coming up for dialer or engagement, that's the ideal time to compare. We can also run a pilot so you see impact before a full commitment—no need to rip and replace overnight."

**Proof Point**:
- 120% quota attainment; 60% ramp; HPE, NFI results
- Pilot and phased rollout possible

**Follow-Up Question**: "When does your current dialer or engagement contract renew? We can align a pilot or business case to that."

---

### 4. "Our reps won't adopt another tool"

**Why They Say This**: Past adoption failures; or fear of change.

**Acknowledge**: "Adoption is critical—another tool that nobody uses doesn't help."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io is built on Salesforce—reps don't leave Salesforce to make calls or get guidance. The dialer and Moments live where they already work. HPE had 100% user adoption across worldwide sales teams; Fundera said reps find it much easier and are unequivocally happy. We're not adding a separate app—we're making the one they use (Salesforce) smarter with the #1 dialer and real-time coaching in the same place."

**Proof Point**:
- HPE 100% user adoption; Fundera "first sales system unequivocally happy with"
- Salesforce-native = no context switching

**Follow-Up Question**: "What's driven low adoption in the past—too many apps, or something else? We can show how Revenue.io fits into the existing Salesforce workflow."

---

### 5. "We need to see more proof before we commit"

**Why They Say This**: Risk aversion; or need internal buy-in.

**Acknowledge**: "Proof matters."

**Respond**: "We have enterprise proof: HPE 400% more opportunities, NFI 10x more meetings and a rep on pace for seven figures, Fundera unequivocally happy, OrthoFX 60% productivity boost, Vagaro 70% conversion and 400% quota attainment. We're also top-rated—AppExchange 4.9, Gartner 4.8, G2 4.7. We can set up a pilot or proof of value so you see results in your environment before a full commitment. What would proof look like for you—pilot, reference call, or ROI model?"

**Proof Point**:
- HPE, NFI, Fundera, OrthoFX, Vagaro, Jan Dils; 120% quota, 60% ramp, $300K rep productivity
- AppExchange 4.9, Gartner 4.8, G2 4.7

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would you need to see in the next 30 days to feel comfortable moving forward?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "How do you coach reps today—in real time or only after the call?"
2. "How many tools do you use for dialer, engagement, and conversation intelligence—and what's the total cost?"
3. "When does your current dialer or engagement contract renew?"
4. "What's your biggest priority this quarter—quota attainment, ramp, or forecast accuracy?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're evaluating moving off Salesforce" (we're Salesforce-only)
- "We only need conversation intelligence" (we sell platform; may prefer Gong)
- No clear owner for sales tech decisions (identify champion and process)

## Quick Reference

| Objection | Key Response | Proof Point |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Already have Gong/Outreach | #1 dialer + Moments in one platform; they have separate dialer | HPE 400%, NFI 10x; one platform |
| Can't justify cost | One platform replaces multiple; map current spend; ROI | 120% quota, 60% ramp; Fundera, OrthoFX |
| Wait until next year | Cost of waiting; renewal = ideal time; pilot available | HPE, NFI; pilot option |
| Reps won't adopt | Salesforce-native; no new app; 100% adoption at HPE | HPE 100% adoption; Fundera |
| Need more proof | Enterprise proof + pilot/POV; what would proof look like? | HPE, NFI, Fundera, OrthoFX, Vagaro; ratings |
