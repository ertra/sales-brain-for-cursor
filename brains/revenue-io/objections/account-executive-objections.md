# Account Executive / Sales Rep - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from AEs and sales reps (end users) when Revenue.io is being rolled out or evaluated. Focus on adoption, ease of use, and "what's in it for me."

## Objections

### 1. "I don't want another tool to log into"

**Why They Say This**: Tool fatigue; or assume Revenue.io is a separate app.

**Acknowledge**: "Nobody wants more logins."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io lives inside Salesforce—you don't log into a separate app. You make calls from Salesforce, get real-time guidance in the same place, and everything logs automatically. So you're not adding a new tool; you're making the one you already use (Salesforce) smarter. Reps at HPE and Fundera found it easier and more helpful—Fundera said it's the first sales system they're unequivocally happy with."

**Proof Point**:
- Salesforce-native; no separate app; automatic logging
- HPE 100% adoption; Fundera "unequivocally happy"

**Follow-Up Question**: "What's the most frustrating part of your current tools—too many apps, or something else?"

### 2. "I don't need someone listening to my calls in real time"

**Why They Say This**: Privacy concern; or misunderstand Moments as "surveillance."

**Acknowledge**: "Your calls are your conversations."

**Respond**: "Moments isn't about someone listening—it's AI giving you live prompts so you don't miss a cue or fumble an objection. It's like having a coach in your ear when you need it: what to say next, how to handle an objection, how to stay on playbook. Reps who have it tell us they don't want to sell without it. It's there to help you close more, not to watch you. All of it stays within your company and our compliance—SOC 2, same as your CRM."

**Proof Point**:
- Moments = live guidance to handle objections, follow cues, close with confidence
- "Help every rep sell like your best rep"; 60% ramp reduction

**Follow-Up Question**: "Have you ever ended a call and thought, 'I should have said X'? Moments helps in the moment so you don't have that regret."

---

### 3. "I'm already doing fine—I don't need coaching"

**Why They Say This**: Top performer; or defensive about feedback.

**Acknowledge**: "If you're already performing, that's great."

**Respond**: "Revenue.io isn't about fixing broken reps—it's about giving everyone the same edge. Even top performers tell us they close more when they have live prompts for objections and next steps. And it takes the admin off your plate: call summaries, follow-up emails, and CRM updates happen automatically so you can focus on selling. So you get less busywork and optional live guidance—you choose how much you lean on Moments."

**Proof Point**:
- Auto summaries, follow-ups, CRM updates; "eliminate manual work" (AE persona)
- 120% quota attainment; $300K rep productivity—whole team lifts

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would make your job easier—less admin, or more support during the call?"

---

### 4. "Will this slow me down?"

**Why They Say This**: Worry about extra steps or learning curve.

**Acknowledge**: "Speed matters."

**Respond**: "It's built to speed you up. You click to dial from Salesforce—no switching apps. Calls log automatically so you're not typing notes after every call. Follow-ups and next steps can be suggested by AI. Moments gives you prompts during the call so you don't waste time figuring out what to say. Customers like HPE saw 400% more opportunities and 100% adoption because reps found it made them more productive, not less."

**Proof Point**:
- One-click dial from Salesforce; automatic logging; AI summaries and follow-ups
- HPE 400% more opportunities; 100% adoption; NFI 10x meetings

**Follow-Up Question**: "What takes the most time today—logging calls, writing follow-ups, or something else? We can show how Revenue.io reduces that."

---

### 5. "We already have Gong / Outreach—why switch?"

**Why They Say This**: Don't see difference; or comfortable with current tool.

**Acknowledge**: "If you're using Gong or Outreach, you're already used to insights."

**Respond**: "The difference is where you work and when you get help. With Revenue.io you stay in Salesforce—dialer, notes, and guidance in one place. And you get live guidance during the call with Moments, not just insights after. So when you hit an objection, you get a prompt in the moment instead of a recap later. Plus everything logs automatically to Salesforce so your pipeline and activities are always up to date. It's one platform for the whole flow: call, coach, close."

**Proof Point**:
- Salesforce-native; Moments = in-call; automatic logging
- HPE, NFI, Fundera chose Revenue.io for full platform

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do you get any live help during the call today—or only after?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early (to Reps / AEs)
1. "How many apps do you switch between in a typical day for calling and logging?"
2. "When you're on a call and hit an objection, do you have any support in the moment?"
3. "What would make your job easier—less admin or more in-call support?"
4. "Have you ever missed a cue or wished you'd said something different after a call?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Strong attachment to current dialer (focus on one platform and less admin)
- "We don't want Big Brother" (reframe Moments as coaching, not surveillance)
- "We're not changing tools" (champion and leadership need to align on consolidation)

## Quick Reference

| Objection | Key Response | Proof Point |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Another tool to log into | Lives in Salesforce; no separate app; auto logging | HPE 100% adoption; Fundera |
| Don't need real-time listening | Moments = AI coach, not surveillance; help you close | 60% ramp; "sell like your best rep" |
| Already doing fine | Edge for everyone; less admin; optional guidance | 120% quota; auto summaries, follow-ups |
| Will this slow me down? | Speeds you up: one-click dial, auto log, AI follow-ups, Moments | HPE 400% opportunities; 100% adoption |
| Already have Gong/Outreach | Stay in Salesforce; Moments in-call; one platform | HPE, NFI, Fundera |
