# Drift

## Company
Salesloft

## Overview
Drift is Salesloft's conversational platform to convert website visitors into pipeline. The Drift AI Chat agent engages visitors with real-time, personalized conversations for a better buyer experience and more qualified leads. Gives marketing, sales, and service teams what they need to have more meaningful conversations online and grow revenue. Rated 4.5 on G2.

## Main Features
- **Live Chat** — Real-time conversations with buyers; skip forms and move them through the funnel faster
- **ROI Reporting** — Track engagement, identify high-converting conversations, attribute to pipeline and revenue; refine strategy
- **Fastlane** — Uses tech stack data to identify and qualify high-value buyers in real time; they skip the form queue and connect immediately
- AI chat agents for accurate, instant answers; personalized conversations; lead qualification; meeting booking or live rep handoff

## Problem Solved
- Unmet buyer expectations — AI answers questions instantly; reduces drop-off and accelerates cycles
- Lack of visibility into intent-based traffic — Drift identifies high-intent visitors, account data (company, location, history), scores engagement, delivers the right chat experience
- Lengthy sales cycles — When high-intent accounts interact, Drift routes qualified buyers into the seller's Rhythm workflow as a prioritized action with context
- Chat strategy optimization — Metrics and attribution to improve performance

## Value Proposition
Faster revenue growth: deanonymize visitors, qualify in real time, and hand off to sales with context in Rhythm — all within the same Revenue Orchestration Platform.

## Target Customers
Marketing, sales, revenue operations; B2B teams that want to convert website traffic into pipeline and meetings.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Standalone chat/widgets | Part of Salesloft; qualified leads flow into Rhythm/Cadence; unified revenue data and workflow |
