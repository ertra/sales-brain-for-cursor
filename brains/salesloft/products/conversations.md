# Conversations

## Company
Salesloft

## Overview
Conversations is Salesloft's conversation intelligence software for revenue insights. It's built into the platform (no separate CI tool). AI agents help teams understand the impact of every sales conversation, share insights, and replicate top-seller behaviors. Record calls, get transcriptions, identify trends. Rated 4.5 on G2.

## Main Features
- **AI-Assisted Scorecards** — AI pre-populates manager scorecards from transcripts; scorecards surface as actions in Rhythm for timely feedback
- **Summaries + Action Items** — Conversation Summary AI agent generates summaries and action items; helps write follow-up emails
- **Conversation Key Moments** — AI surfaces competitors, objections, decision-makers from transcripts for deal strategy and coaching
- **Tracker Trends** — Visualize patterns (e.g. competitor mentions, price sensitivity) across conversations
- **Call Recording & Transcription** — Automatic recording and transcription for reference; sellers stay fully engaged on calls

## Problem Solved
- Deals slipping — AI transcribes, analyzes, summarizes; links to deals; teams act on insights for better outcomes
- Seller efforts not aligned with buyer needs — AI consolidates past conversations, key moments, deal summaries into a "cheat sheet" for meeting prep; surfaced in Rhythm
- Coaching deprioritized — AI highlights coachable moments; reduces manual review so managers coach more effectively

## Value Proposition
Turn conversation insights into actions that win deals: know what's happening in every deal, prepare faster, and coach with data-driven feedback inside the workflow.

## Target Customers
Sales managers, revenue operations, front-line sellers; teams that need call visibility, coaching at scale, and deal-level conversation insights.
