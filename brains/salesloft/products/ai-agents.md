# AI Agents

## Company
Salesloft

## Overview
Salesloft AI Agents are purpose-built for sellers to solve key challenges in the sales cycle and drive revenue outcomes. They work as an extension of the team — handling tedious tasks, surfacing insights, and anticipating the next move. Dozens of agents automate busywork so teams can focus on pipeline, winning deals, and customer relationships.

## Main Features
**Prospecting & pipeline:** Account Research, Person Research, Buyer Identification (ZoomInfo), Drift Chat, AI Email Steps for Cadence, AI Email Tasks for Plays, AI for LinkedIn and Call Scripts (coming), Generative AI Email Assistant (coming), Rhythm Prioritizer, Rhythm Priority Account, Ask Salesloft.

**Deals & forecast:** Deal Summaries, AI Forecast, Analytics Interpreter.  
**Custom:** Create Your Own Agent — connect first/third-party signals; control how, when, and for whom each agent deploys.

## Problem Solved
- Manual, repetitive tasks (research, emails, follow-ups, data entry)
- Lack of prioritization and next-best-action clarity
- Scattered insights across tools; coaching and deal visibility gaps

## Value Proposition
Agents that work with you, not instead of you: purpose-built for the sales cycle, embedded in Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, and Drift. Same platform, unified data, governance and security at scale.

## Target Customers
Revenue teams (SDRs, AEs, managers, RevOps); organizations adopting agentic AI for sales productivity.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Generic AI assistants | Salesloft agents are tied to specific workflows (cadence, deals, conversations, forecast); native to one platform |

## Pricing Model
Included in Salesloft platform packages; some agents "Available Now," others "Coming" (e.g. Winter/Fall 2025).
