# Sales - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales teams (SDRs, AEs, sales leaders) struggle with inefficient prospecting, manual follow-up and research, unclear prioritization, and pipeline/forecast visibility. Deals slip when hot leads go cold, pipeline reviews take too long, and coaching isn’t tied to what actually wins. They need one place to prospect, close, and coach — with less admin and clearer next steps.

## Pain Points

### 1. Inefficient prospecting and missed opportunities
- **Description**: Inefficient workflows hold back even the best teams; wrong leads get attention, best prospects aren’t engaged when it matters, and manual processes lead to missed opportunities.
- **Impact**: Junk pipeline, money left on the table, low response-to-opportunity rates; reps can’t scale personalization.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual list work, spreadsheets, multiple tools, or acceptance of inconsistent pipeline quality.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Cadence (Buyer Identification Agent, cadence frameworks, A/B testing), Rhythm (prioritization), AI agents (account/person research, email)
- **Key Message**: "Predictable pipeline is possible — target the right buyers, engage at the right time, and let AI prioritize so no hot lead goes cold."

### 2. Time wasted on manual tasks and admin
- **Description**: Reps spend hours on research, CRM updates, summaries, and follow-up emails instead of selling. Pipeline review and deal prep are manual and time-consuming.
- **Impact**: Less time in front of buyers; "Deals tab cut our pipeline review time by half" (Beam) shows how painful manual reviews are; reps feel like data-entry clerks.
- **Current Solutions**: Templates, ad-hoc notes, or living with outdated CRM and scattered context.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI agents (research, summaries, action items, deal summaries), Cadence (automation, capture), Rhythm (prioritized workflow), Deals (single view, AI next steps)
- **Key Message**: "Cut the busywork — automation and AI agents turn hours of research and updates into seconds so you focus on closing."

### 3. Unclear where to focus; hot leads go cold
- **Description**: Knowing where to focus team attention is hard; disconnected buyer and seller experiences; reps forget to follow up or don’t know which accounts and deals to work first.
- **Impact**: Deals slip; valuable time lost on non-selling activities and tool-switching; reps say "Rhythm doesn’t let me forget to follow up with my buyers."
- **Current Solutions**: Manual prioritization, spreadsheets, or hope that reps remember.
- **Frequency**: Daily / per deal
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Rhythm (Priority Accounts Agent, Signals, Plays, Focus Zones), Cadence Focus Zone
- **Key Message**: "Take the right actions at the right moments — buyer signals in one place, translated into a prioritized workflow so nothing falls through the cracks."

### 4. Pipeline and forecast visibility; deal risk too late
- **Description**: Misaligned teams, incomplete or disconnected data; deal risk and stalled opportunities surface too late; forecast isn’t tight enough.
- **Impact**: Forecast surprises; last-minute scrambles; "We’re able to get much tighter around what our forecast actually looks like" (Beam) — implies prior pain.
- **Current Solutions**: Repetitive deal reviews, CRM-only views, or reactive firefighting.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly (forecast and pipeline reviews)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Deals (real-time views, risks, progression), Forecast (AI, real-time data), Command Center (holistic view, deal risks, coaching prompts)
- **Key Message**: "Call your number with confidence — real-time deal visibility, AI forecast, and agents that flag risks so you act before it’s too late."

### 5. Coaching deprioritized or not tied to what wins
- **Description**: Getting the right insights to coach reps is manual and time-consuming; results in less coaching, lower performance, and risk to revenue. Objections and stalled deals surface too late.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent execution; managers can’t replicate winning behaviors or give targeted, timely feedback.
- **Frequency**: Weekly (1:1s, pipeline reviews)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Conversations (AI scorecards, key moments, summaries, action items), Command Center (risks, coaching prompts), Rhythm (actions in workflow)
- **Key Message**: "Coach to close — AI highlights exactly where to spend time and surfaces scorecards and coachable moments in your workflow."

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time do reps spend on research, CRM updates, and follow-up emails vs. actual selling?
2. How do you decide which accounts and deals to work first — and do hot leads ever go cold because of follow-up gaps?
3. How long do pipeline and deal reviews take, and where does "real" context live — CRM or elsewhere?
4. When do you usually find out a deal is at risk or stalled — and what would you need to see it earlier?
5. How do you coach reps today, and do you have an objective view of what top performers do differently?

## Trigger Events
- Missed quarterly forecast or surprise deal loss
- New sales leader or push to improve win rate / cycle time
- Scaling team without proportional headcount
- Consolidating or replacing multiple sales tools
- Board or exec pressure on pipeline and predictability
