# Marketing - Pain Points

## Overview
Marketing teams struggle to convert website visitors into qualified pipeline, lack visibility into intent-based traffic, and often operate in a silo from sales. Unqualified opportunities waste budget; lengthy cycles and poor handoff slow revenue. They need to engage in-market buyers, prove pipeline impact, and align with sales on one platform.

## Pain Points

### 1. Unmet buyer expectations on the website
- **Description**: Site visitors don’t get accurate or instant answers; generic experiences and forms lead to drop-off and slow cycles. Buyers expect personalized, real-time engagement.
- **Impact**: Lost conversions, slower sales cycles, and missed pipeline from high-intent visitors.
- **Current Solutions**: Forms, generic chat, or reliance on sales to follow up later.
- **Frequency**: Daily (every visitor session)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Drift (AI chat agents, real-time personalized conversations, meeting booking, live rep handoff)
- **Key Message**: "Improve the buying experience — AI chat agents provide accurate, instant answers and keep prospects engaged so you accelerate sales cycles."

### 2. Lack of visibility into intent-based web traffic
- **Description**: When a prospect lands on the website, marketing and sales often don’t know who they are. Anonymous traffic; no real-time scoring or routing based on intent.
- **Impact**: Can’t target the right accounts at the right time; waste time on unqualified opportunities; miss high-intent buyers.
- **Current Solutions**: Third-party intent data in silos, or no intent visibility.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Drift (deanonymize visitors, account data, engagement scores, AI prioritization agent); buyer signals; 6sense, ZoomInfo, Crunchbase
- **Key Message**: "Deanonymize site visitors — know who they are, score engagement in real time, and deliver the right chat experience to convert."

### 3. Lengthy and disconnected sales cycles; poor handoff
- **Description**: When high-intent visitors engage, they aren’t seamlessly routed to sales with context. Lengthy cycles; disconnect between marketing touchpoints and sales follow-up.
- **Impact**: Pipeline velocity suffers; sales doesn’t have context; buyers fall through the cracks.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual handoff, lead forms, or hope that sales follows up in time.
- **Frequency**: Per lead / per campaign
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Drift → Rhythm (qualified buyers as prioritized actions with context); sync cadences to campaigns; real-time notifications for reps; meeting booking
- **Key Message**: "Drive more qualified pipeline faster — when visitors from high-intent accounts interact, they’re routed into the seller’s workflow with context and a clear next step."

### 4. Not knowing which chats and campaigns convert
- **Description**: Hard to track which conversations and tactics drive pipeline and revenue; can’t optimize strategy or prove marketing ROI.
- **Impact**: Budget and effort wasted on low-converting tactics; can’t set benchmarks or refine approach.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Drift (ROI reporting, engagement metrics, attribution to pipeline and revenue)
- **Key Message**: "Optimize your chat strategy — track engagement, identify high-converting conversations, and attribute success to pipeline and revenue."

### 5. Sales and marketing misalignment
- **Description**: Marketing and sales operate in silos; cadences and campaigns aren’t synced; handoff is manual or inconsistent.
- **Impact**: "Drift is helping us hit our pipeline goals and align our sales and marketing teams" (Lindsay Hasz) — implies prior misalignment pain.
- **Current Solutions**: Regular sync meetings, SLAs, or acceptance of friction.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Drift + Cadence + Rhythm (sync cadences to campaigns, real-time notifications, one platform)
- **Key Message**: "Connect sales and marketing — sync cadences to campaigns, speed up cycles, and create seamless customer experiences."

## Discovery Questions
1. When a high-intent visitor is on your site today, what happens — and how quickly does sales get context?
2. How much of your website traffic do you actually know (company, intent)? What would change if you could deanonymize and score in real time?
3. How do you today attribute pipeline and revenue to specific campaigns or chat experiences?
4. How aligned are marketing and sales on handoff and follow-up — and where does it break down?
5. What would "hitting pipeline goals" look like if marketing and sales were on the same system?

## Trigger Events
- New CMO or demand-gen lead; pipeline or conversion targets raised
- Website redesign or traffic growth without proportional pipeline growth
- Push for ABM or account-based engagement
- Sales complaining about lead quality or follow-up timing
- Board or exec ask for marketing ROI and attribution
