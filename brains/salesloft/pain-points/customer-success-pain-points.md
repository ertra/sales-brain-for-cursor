# Customer Success - Pain Points

## Overview
Customer Success teams struggle to scale engagement, anticipate churn, and prove impact on retention and expansion. Inconsistent touchpoints, manual follow-ups, and lack of visibility into health and next best actions make it hard to deliver value and earn loyalty. They need to reduce churn, spot growth opportunities, and close renewals with confidence — often on the same platform as sales.

## Pain Points

### 1. Churn anticipated too late; manual mitigation
- **Description**: Churn is discovered when it’s too late to save the customer; mitigation is reactive and manual. No single view of risk and health.
- **Impact**: Lost revenue; reactive firefighting; inability to scale touchpoints for at-risk accounts.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual health checks, NPS/CSAT surveys, or learning from churn post-mortems.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / per account
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Data and AI agents to anticipate churn and drive timely mitigation; Forecast (renewals, churn, expansions); Deals (visibility into risks)
- **Key Message**: "Combat churn using real-time insights — data and AI agents help anticipate churn and drive timely mitigation."

### 2. Inconsistent engagement; hard to personalize at scale
- **Description**: Delivering consistent, personalized content and touchpoints across many customers is manual; generic messaging doesn’t build champions.
- **Impact**: Lower loyalty and adoption; missed opportunities to delight and expand.
- **Current Solutions**: One-off emails, spreadsheets, or broad-brush campaigns.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Cadence (best-practice frameworks, multi-touch campaigns personalized by generative AI for onboarding, adoption, renewals, expansions); any channel from workflow
- **Key Message**: "Create champions with consistent engagement — delight customers with relevant, personalized content tailored to each individual with generative AI, delivered to any channel from your workflow."

### 3. Lack of visibility into growth opportunities
- **Description**: Hard to know which customers are ready to expand or what they need next; actions aren’t aligned to deepen relationships or create new opportunities.
- **Impact**: Revenue left on the table; expansion and upsell happen by chance or too late.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual review, account plans, or reactive responses to inbound requests.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Account prioritization agents (analyze buyer signals, understand desires, anticipate next moves); align actions to deepen relationships; Deals (renewals, upgrades, partner resells)
- **Key Message**: "Increase revenue by spotting growth opportunities — prioritization agents analyze signals to understand customer desires and anticipate next moves."

### 4. Renewals and critical touchpoints don’t scale
- **Description**: Renewals and critical touchpoints (onboarding, adoption, expansion) are manual or inconsistent; no automations that scale for key moments.
- **Impact**: Renewal risk; CS team bottleneck; inconsistent customer experience.
- **Current Solutions**: Calendar reminders, one-off outreach, or hope that customers self-serve.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (renewal cycles, onboarding, QBRs)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Cadence (multi-touch for onboarding, adoption, renewals, expansions); automations that scale for critical touchpoints; Forecast for renewals
- **Key Message**: "Close more renewals using automations that scale for critical touchpoints — and forecast accurately for renewals, churn, and expansions."

### 5. No single view of customer health and deal risk
- **Description**: New deals, renewals, upgrades, and partner resells live in different places; deal risk and health aren’t visible in one workflow.
- **Impact**: Selling team not aligned; risks missed; "After using Salesloft, I could never imagine working without it... schedule webinars, updates, and follow-up meetings with ease" (G2) implies prior chaos.
- **Current Solutions**: CRM only, spreadsheets, or multiple tools.
- **Frequency**: Daily–Weekly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Deals (visibility into new deals, renewals, upgrades, partner resells; agent-generated summaries; assess and act on flagged risks in workflow); Conversations (align on insights)
- **Key Message**: "Protect and grow revenue with visibility into all deals and renewals — agent-generated summaries and risks in your workflow so the whole team stays updated."

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you today anticipate which customers might churn — and when do you usually find out?
2. How do you personalize touchpoints for onboarding, adoption, and renewals — and can you do it at scale?
3. How do you identify expansion and growth opportunities — and who acts on them?
4. How do you manage renewal touchpoints and critical moments — manual or automated?
5. Where do CS and sales see customer health and deal risk — one place or scattered?

## Trigger Events

- New CS leader or initiative to "scale touch"
- Push for expansion revenue or NRR targets
- Sales and CS alignment initiative (e.g. one platform)
