# Revenue Operations - Pain Points

## Overview
RevOps teams struggle with scattered data, siloed systems, and manual processes. They need to align sales and success on one platform, untangle revenue complexity, and govern GTM without sacrificing productivity. Repetitive deal reviews, inconsistent workflows, and lack of visibility across the funnel create risk and slow growth.

## Pain Points

### 1. Scattered data and siloed teams
- **Description**: Data lives across CRM, engagement tools, and other systems; teams swivel-chair between tools; no single view of buying signals and funnel health.
- **Impact**: Can’t align teams or activate data effectively; AI and automation are limited by fragmented foundations.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual reporting, spreadsheets, or acceptance of incomplete visibility.
- **Frequency**: Daily / ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Platform unification (Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Drift, Forecast, Analytics); 180+ integrations; cross-platform analytics
- **Key Message**: "Harness and consolidate the power of your full revenue stack — one platform that connects your entire tech stack, no engineering required."

### 2. Untangled revenue complexity; gaps and opportunities invisible
- **Description**: Revenue complexities are hard to untangle; gaps and areas of opportunity across the full funnel aren’t visible in one place.
- **Impact**: Teams don’t get the right prompts; performance improvements are reactive instead of driven by insight.
- **Current Solutions**: Ad-hoc analysis, tribal knowledge, or dealing with gaps when they become crises.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: AI insights and agents that show gaps and opportunity; prompt right actions in workflow; Rhythm, Deals, Forecast
- **Key Message**: "AI insights show you gaps and areas of opportunity across your full sales funnel in one place — and immediately improve performance by prompting the right actions."

### 3. Repetitive deal reviews and forecast inaccuracy
- **Description**: Repetitive deal reviews consume time; forecasting is manual or inaccurate; risks are spotted too late.
- **Impact**: Ineffective planning; inability to pressure-test projections or focus on the right actions.
- **Current Solutions**: Long review cycles, spreadsheet forecasts, or delayed risk response.
- **Frequency**: Weekly–Monthly (forecast cycles)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Forecast (AI, cross-platform data, integrate into seller workflows), Deals (real-time views, risks), automation
- **Key Message**: "Eliminate repetitive deal reviews, spot risks fast, and execute confidently with AI Forecast and timely forecasts in seller workflows."

### 4. Inconsistent workflows and lack of best practices
- **Description**: Workflows are inconsistent; best practices aren’t enforced at scale; friction in the buying journey.
- **Impact**: Repeatable revenue is hard; time is wasted; buying experience suffers.
- **Current Solutions**: Playbooks that aren’t embedded in tools, or acceptance of variability.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Cadence (repeatable plays, content), Rhythm (Plays, Focus Zones), automation rules; one platform for consistency
- **Key Message**: "Create consistency with workflows — maximize time, instill best practices, and drive repeatable revenue with configurable plays and automations."

### 5. Governance and accountability without productivity trade-off
- **Description**: Need to govern GTM initiatives — role-based access, auditability, compliance — without slowing down reps or requiring heavy IT.
- **Impact**: Either governance is loose (risk) or heavy-handed (productivity drop).
- **Current Solutions**: Manual provisioning, spreadsheets, or one-size-fits-all access.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing / at scale
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: Enterprise-grade governance and controls; easily provision each role with custom granularity; Trust Center
- **Key Message**: "Confidently govern your go-to-market initiatives — ideal balance of productivity and accountability with enterprise-grade controls."

## Discovery Questions
1. How many tools does your revenue team use day to day, and where does "source of truth" live for pipeline and forecast?
2. How do you today identify gaps and opportunities across the funnel — and do reps get prompted to act on them?
3. How much time goes into deal reviews and forecasting, and when do you typically spot deal or forecast risk?
4. How do you enforce best practices and consistency across reps — playbooks, tools, or both?
5. How do you balance governance and access control with rep productivity and speed?

## Trigger Events
- Tech stack consolidation or CRM change
- New RevOps leader or initiative to "align revenue"
- Board or exec ask for one view of pipeline and forecast
- Compliance or audit requirements
- Scaling to new segments or regions
