# Competitor: Gong

## Overview
Gong positions as the Revenue AI OS with the "world's richest revenue graph" — a single data layer of every revenue interaction, with Engage (sales engagement), Forecast, and AI Agents as apps on top. They compete on conversation/revenue intelligence depth and Gartner Leader positioning. Salesloft competes with a full Revenue Orchestration Platform that unifies engagement (Cadence), prioritization (Rhythm), conversation intelligence (Conversations), deals (Deals), forecast (Forecast), and website chat (Drift) in one workflow, with 10-day time to value and purpose-built AI agents embedded throughout.

## Product Overview
Gong Revenue AI OS: Revenue Graph (single data layer of interactions), Engage (sales engagement), Forecast, Agents. Multimodal revenue signal processing and specialized AI agents. "From prospecting to expansion."

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Revenue Graph | Single graph of every interaction | Salesloft: unified platform data model + Rhythm/Cadence/Conversations |
| Engage | Sales engagement, prioritize and personalize | Cadence, Rhythm |
| Forecast | Forecast accuracy, unbiased insights | Forecast, Deals |
| Agents | Follow-ups, pipeline edits, enablement, forecast corrections | Salesloft AI Agents |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "The #1 AI operating system for Revenue Teams"; "Revenue AI OS"
- **Key Message**: Revenue Graph as foundation; conversation and interaction data at the core; productivity, predictability, growth
- **Target Market**: GTM organizations wanting revenue intelligence and data-first architecture; Gartner Leader narrative

## Strengths
- Revenue Graph as differentiator: one living network of every interaction; data-first story
- Gartner Leader in 2025 Magic Quadrant for Revenue Action Orchestration
- Strong conversation/revenue intelligence narrative; forecast and deal risk from conversation signals
- Pitchbook and other case studies (e.g. 10x efficiency)

## Weaknesses
- No website chat / conversion (Drift equivalent); Salesloft has Drift for website-to-pipeline
- Engagement (Engage) may be positioned as app on top of graph; Salesloft built engagement-first with Cadence + Rhythm, then full platform
- "Data-first" can mean longer or different implementation; Salesloft emphasizes 10-day time to value and workflow-first
- Total cost and scope differ by deal; both premium

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Salesloft | Gong | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| Sales engagement / cadence | ✅ Cadence (mature) | ✅ Engage | Salesloft: long history, Cadence + Rhythm prioritization in one workflow |
| Conversation intelligence | ✅ Conversations | ✅ Core (Revenue Graph) | Gong: data layer is product; Salesloft: built into workflow (Rhythm, scorecards) |
| Deal management | ✅ Deals | ✅ Forecast/pipeline | Salesloft: dedicated Deals, Close Focus Zone, buying group, MEDDPICC |
| Forecasting | ✅ Forecast | ✅ Forecast | Both AI; Salesloft integrates into Rhythm and seller workflow |
| Website chat / conversion | ✅ Drift | ❌ | Salesloft unique; Gong no direct equivalent |
| Prioritization / next best action | ✅ Rhythm, Focus Zones | ✅ Agents/workflows | Salesloft: Rhythm as core (signals → prioritized workflow) |
| Time to value | ✅ 10 days cited | ⚠️ Varies | Salesloft: "meaningful results in first 10 days" |
| Unified workflow | ✅ One platform | ✅ Revenue AI OS | Salesloft: workflow-first; Gong: data-first (graph then apps) |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Salesloft)
- Website chat and conversion (Drift) are must-haves; need to turn visitors into pipeline in one platform
- Sales engagement and "one workflow" are primary — cadences, prioritization, deals, and conversations in a single daily workflow
- Fast time to value is critical; 10-day results and industry's fastest time to ROI matter
- Prospect wants one vendor for full revenue workflow including chat, not just intelligence layer
- Strong Salesloft/Cadence/Drift champion; existing investment

### When They Win (Gong)
- Revenue intelligence and "one source of truth" mean one graph of every interaction; data unification over workflow unification
- Forecast and pipeline must be grounded primarily in conversation analysis; conversation-backed everything is the priority
- CRO/RevOps want Revenue AI OS with data at the center first, then apps
- Customer already has or prefers best-in-class engagement elsewhere and wants best-in-class intelligence only
- Gartner Leader and "Revenue Action Orchestration" are key decision criteria

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Drift (website chat)**: Only Salesloft offers AI chat and website-to-pipeline in the same platform; Gong has no direct equivalent. Convert visitors into pipeline and route to Rhythm with context.
2. **One workflow, 10-day value**: Full Revenue Orchestration in one workflow (Cadence, Rhythm, Conversations, Deals, Forecast, Drift); meaningful results in first 10 days; workflow-first so reps and managers live in one place.
3. **Rhythm + Focus Zones**: Prioritization and next-best-action are core — signals translated into prioritized workflow, Focus Zones by area (Cadence, Close); Gong positions engagement as app on graph.
4. **Proof points**: 3M 2.5x faster close; Wrike $350k savings and visibility; NFP $1M+ revenue; Beam pipeline review cut by half; Forrester TEI (254%, 60%, 50% faster reviews).

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Revenue Graph = one source of truth" | Strong for conversation-backed data | Salesloft has one platform and one workflow; data unified in our model. Do you need data-first architecture or workflow-first so reps don't swivel-chair? |
| "Gartner Leader" | True; strong positioning | Salesloft is the leading Revenue Orchestration Platform with 5,000+ customers; 10-day time to value and Drift are unique. What matters more: Gartner badge or time to value and full workflow including chat? |
| "Conversation-backed forecast" | Strength of Gong | We have Conversations + Deals + Forecast in one workflow; deal risk and next steps in Rhythm. Forecast fed by real-time deal data and AI. |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Gong
"Gong is strong on revenue intelligence and the Revenue Graph story. The key question is whether you want data-first — one graph of every interaction, then apps — or workflow-first: one place where reps build pipeline (Cadence), get next actions (Rhythm), manage deals (Deals), get coaching (Conversations), and forecast, with website chat (Drift) in the same platform. We also deliver meaningful results in the first 10 days. Do you need website-to-pipeline in the same vendor, and how important is time to value?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Gong
1. Lead with full platform and Drift: only Salesloft gives you website chat and conversion in the same Revenue Orchestration Platform.
2. Emphasize 10-day time to value and workflow-first: one place for cadence, prioritization, deals, conversations, forecast — no swivel-chairing.
3. Use proof points: 2.5x faster close (3M), $350k savings (Wrike), pipeline review cut by half (Beam), Forrester TEI for pipeline creation.
4. If they care most about conversation-backed forecast, show Conversations + Deals + Forecast integration and deal risk in Rhythm.
5. Ask: "Where do your sellers live day to day — one workflow or multiple tools? Do you need website conversion in that same platform?"

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Do you need to convert website visitors into pipeline in the same platform as your sales workflow, or is that a separate tool?" (Salesloft: Drift in same platform.)
2. "How quickly do you need to see productivity and pipeline results — weeks or 10 days?" (Salesloft: meaningful results in 10 days.)
3. "When reps prioritize their day, do they get one prioritized list from one system, or pull from multiple places?" (Salesloft: Rhythm in one workflow.)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Salesloft | Gong |
|--|-----------|------|
| Model | Per seat / platform packages | Per seat / platform |
| Perception | Value in full orchestration + Drift + 10-day value | Value in Revenue Graph and intelligence depth |
| Key Differences | Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Drift, 10-day time to value | Revenue Graph, Gartner Leader, conversation-backed |
