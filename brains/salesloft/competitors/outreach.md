# Competitor: Outreach

## Overview
Outreach positions as the "AI Revenue Workflow Platform" with AI Agents for revenue teams. They offer prospect/engage, forecast/plan, manage deals, coach/improve, and retain/expand in one platform. Salesloft competes with a full Revenue Orchestration Platform that includes Cadence (engagement), Rhythm (prioritization and next-best-action), Conversations (conversation intelligence), Deals, Forecast, Drift (website chat), and purpose-built AI agents — with 10-day time to value and 5,000+ customers including 3M, Wrike, NFP.

## Company Information

- **Founded**: 2014
- **Headquarters**: Seattle, WA
- **Company Size**: 1,000+ employees

## Product Overview
Outreach AI Revenue Workflow Platform: AI Agents for prospecting/engagement, forecast/plan, deal management, coaching, retain/expand. "The only end-to-end sales solution" — forecast, coach, close deals, renew, expand, build pipeline. Security, privacy, governance.

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Prospect & Engage | AI-driven workflows, organize books, timely messages, meetings | Cadence, Rhythm |
| Forecast & Plan | AI-assisted modeling, validate calls, compare outcomes | Forecast, Deals |
| Manage Deals | Inspect pipeline, uncover risks, prioritize actions | Deals, Rhythm |
| Coach & Improve | Conversation insights, coaching opportunities, feedback | Conversations |
| Retain & Expand | Renewal risks, retention plays, expansion | Cadence (CS), Deals, Forecast |
| AI Agents | Best-fit prospects, automate research, next best actions | Salesloft AI Agents |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "AI Revenue Workflow Platform"; "Sales leaders trust Outreach"
- **Key Message**: One AI-powered platform; workflow first, results driven; orchestrate every stage of sales; increase seller productivity 60% (cited); Amplitude saved $600K+ and consolidated from five platforms to one
- **Target Market**: Sales, marketing, RevOps, customer success; teams wanting end-to-end sales solution

## Strengths
- Strong sales engagement heritage; "trusted sales platform"
- AI Agents narrative; 60% productivity claim; Amplitude tech stack consolidation story ($600K+)
- Six pillars: prospect/engage, forecast/plan, manage deals, coach, retain/expand
- Security, privacy, governance called out

## Weaknesses
- No native website chat/conversion (Drift equivalent) in platform; Salesloft has Drift for website-to-pipeline in same platform
- Conversation intelligence may be one capability among many; Salesloft has Conversations built into workflow with Rhythm (scorecards, key moments in manager workflow)
- Salesloft emphasizes 10-day time to value and "industry's fastest time to ROI"; Outreach messaging less specific on time to value
- Rhythm/Focus Zones and prioritization as core product (signals → prioritized workflow) differentiator for Salesloft

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Salesloft | Outreach | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Sales engagement / sequences | ✅ Cadence | ✅ Prospect & Engage | Both mature; Salesloft has Rhythm prioritization + Cadence |
| Prioritization / next best action | ✅ Rhythm, Focus Zones, Plays | ✅ AI Agents | Salesloft: Rhythm as core product (signals → workflow); Focus Zones by area |
| Conversation intelligence | ✅ Conversations | ✅ Coach & Improve | Salesloft: scorecards, key moments in Rhythm workflow |
| Deal management | ✅ Deals (Close Focus Zone, buying group, MEDDPICC) | ✅ Manage Deals | Salesloft: dedicated Deals + AI agents |
| Forecasting | ✅ Forecast | ✅ Forecast & Plan | Both AI-assisted |
| Website chat / conversion | ✅ Drift | ❌ | Salesloft only: Drift in same platform |
| Retain & expand | ✅ Cadence (CS), Deals, Forecast | ✅ Retain & Expand | Both support |
| Time to value | ✅ 10 days cited | ⚠️ Not emphasized | Salesloft: "meaningful results in first 10 days" |
| Tech stack consolidation proof | ✅ Wrike $350k | ✅ Amplitude $600K+ | Both have consolidation stories |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win (Salesloft)
- Website chat and conversion must be in the same platform as sales workflow (Drift); no separate chat vendor
- Prospect cares about 10-day time to value and "industry's fastest time to ROI"
- Rhythm and Focus Zones matter: one prioritized workflow from signals (Cadence Focus Zone, Close Focus Zone, Plays)
- Conversation intelligence and coaching should surface in manager workflow (scorecards, key moments in Rhythm)
- Preference for "Revenue Orchestration" and 5,000+ customers (3M, Wrike, NFP, Beam proof points)

### When They Win (Outreach)
- Prospect already standardized on Outreach; strong champion and adoption
- Amplitude-style consolidation story and $600K+ savings are key proof point they want
- "AI Revenue Workflow Platform" and "60% productivity" messaging resonates more than Salesloft narrative
- Evaluation heavily weighted on sales engagement only (no Drift requirement)

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Drift (website chat)**: Only Salesloft offers AI chat and website-to-pipeline in the same Revenue Orchestration Platform. Convert visitors into pipeline and route to Rhythm with context; align marketing and sales on one platform.
2. **Rhythm + Focus Zones**: Prioritization is a core product — Rhythm translates buyer signals into a prioritized workflow; Focus Zones (Cadence, Close) and Plays keep reps in one workflow. Outreach has AI Agents; Salesloft has Rhythm as the central "right actions at the right moments" layer.
3. **10-day time to value**: Salesloft emphasizes meaningful productivity, deal visibility, and pipeline action within the first 10 days; "industry's fastest time to ROI." Strong for fast implementation and exec mandate.
4. **Conversations in workflow**: Scorecards and key moments surface as actions in manager's Rhythm workflow; coaching tied to workflow, not separate. Proof: pipeline review cut by half (Beam), 2.5x faster close (3M).

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Only end-to-end sales solution" | Strong platform | Salesloft is full Revenue Orchestration: Cadence, Rhythm, Conversations, Deals, Forecast, Drift, AI agents. Plus 10-day value and Drift for website conversion. |
| "60% productivity" | Claimed | Salesloft has Forrester TEI (254% more opportunities, 60% response-to-opportunity, 50% faster reviews); Rhythm (20% cycle, 25% close); pipeline review cut by half (Beam). |
| "Amplitude $600K savings" | Strong proof | We have Wrike $350k savings and visibility; 3M 2.5x faster; NFP $1M+ revenue. Same consolidation story, plus Drift and 10-day value. |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Outreach
"Outreach has a strong platform and good consolidation story like Amplitude. The key differences: we offer Drift in the same platform so website visitors become pipeline in one workflow, we emphasize 10-day time to value and industry's fastest time to ROI, and Rhythm is built so reps get one prioritized list from buyer signals — Cadence Focus Zone, Close Focus Zone, Plays. We also have 3M at 2.5x faster close, Wrike at $350k savings, and NFP at over $1M revenue. Do you need website conversion in the same platform, and how important is time to first value?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Outreach
1. Lead with Drift: only Salesloft has website chat and conversion in the same platform; route qualified visitors to Rhythm with context.
2. Emphasize 10-day time to value and Rhythm/Focus Zones: one workflow, one prioritized list, Focus Zones by area.
3. Use proof points: 2.5x faster (3M), $350k (Wrike), $1M+ (NFP), pipeline review cut by half (Beam), Forrester TEI.
4. Show Conversations and coaching in workflow: scorecards and key moments in Rhythm so managers don't leave the platform.
5. Ask: "When you consolidate to one platform, do you want website conversion included, and do you need results in the first 10 days?"

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "Where do website visitors and chat conversations go — into the same platform as your sellers' workflow or a separate tool?" (Salesloft: Drift in same platform.)
2. "How long from go-live to meaningful productivity and pipeline results?" (Salesloft: 10 days.)
3. "When a rep opens their day, do they get one prioritized list from one system or multiple?" (Salesloft: Rhythm, Focus Zones.)

| Perception | Full orchestration + Drift + 10-day value | AI Revenue Workflow; consolidation |
