# Use Case: Customer Loyalty & Growth

## Overview
Customer Success and sales teams need to retain, expand, and delight existing customers — reduce churn, create champions, spot growth opportunities, and close renewals with confidence. This use case addresses reactive churn management, inconsistent engagement, lack of visibility into health and expansion, and the need to scale critical touchpoints.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B with recurring revenue and expansion/renewal motion; SaaS, professional services, manufacturing
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; CS and sales teams focused on retention, adoption, expansion, renewals
- **Characteristics**: Need to reduce churn, increase NRR; often use CRM and sometimes separate CS tools; want one platform with sales for alignment

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Customer Success Manager, CS Leader
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Account Executives (expansion), Revenue Operations, Sales Leader

### Trigger Event
Churn spike or renewal miss; NRR or retention target increase; new CS leader or "scale touch" initiative; push for expansion revenue; sales and CS alignment initiative

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Churn discovered too late; mitigation reactive and manual; no single view of risk and health
- Inconsistent engagement; generic content; hard to personalize at scale for onboarding, adoption, renewals
- Lack of visibility into growth opportunities and next best actions; expansion and renewals by chance or manual review
- Renewals and critical touchpoints (onboarding, QBRs) don't scale; CS team bottleneck
- Customer health and deal risk scattered across systems; selling team not aligned

### Desired State (After)
- Reduce churn and cultivate trust; data and AI agents anticipate churn and drive timely mitigation
- Create champions with consistent engagement; delight customers with relevant, personalized content (generative AI) delivered to any channel from workflow
- Increase revenue by spotting growth opportunities; prioritization agents analyze signals to understand desires and anticipate next moves
- Close more renewals with automations that scale for critical touchpoints; forecast accurately for renewals, churn, expansions
- Protect and grow revenue with visibility into all deals, renewals, upgrades; agent-generated summaries and risks in workflow

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Cadence (customer cadences for onboarding, adoption, renewals, expansions; AI-personalized multi-touch)
- **Supporting**: Conversations (insights, action items), Forecast (renewals, churn, expansions), Deals (renewals, upgrades, partner resells; risks), AI prioritization agents

### Solution Overview
Cadence runs best-practice-based cadence frameworks for new customers and recurring revenue: multi-touch campaigns personalized by generative AI for onboarding, adoption, renewals, and expansions. Conversations builds trust with real-time insights and AI-generated action items and summaries. Forecast provides renewal, churn, and expansion forecasting with built-in AI analysis. Deals gives visibility into new deals, renewals, upgrades, partner resells, with agent-generated deal summaries and flagged risks in workflow. Account prioritization agents analyze buyer signals to deepen relationships and create new opportunities. Automations scale critical touchpoints so CS can close more renewals without proportionally scaling headcount.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Cadence for customer-facing campaigns; configure cadences for onboarding, adoption, renewals, expansions with AI personalization
2. Enable Conversations and link to customer calls/meetings; surface action items and summaries in workflow
3. Roll out Forecast for renewals/churn/expansions; Deals for renewal and expansion visibility and risk
4. Configure prioritization agents and automations for critical touchpoints; align CS and sales on one platform
