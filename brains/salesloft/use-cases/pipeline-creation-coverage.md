# Use Case: Pipeline Creation & Coverage

## Overview
Revenue teams need to transform prospects into a healthy, qualified pipeline — and avoid "junk" pipeline and money left on the table. This use case addresses inefficient prospecting, low response-to-opportunity rates, and the need to scale personalized engagement with the right buyers at the right time.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B with outbound or inbound SDR/BDR motion; professional services, manufacturing, tech, medical
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; teams measured on opportunities created, meetings booked, pipeline coverage
- **Characteristics**: Need predictable pipeline; multi-channel engagement; often use CRM and one or more engagement tools

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Development (SDR/BDR), Sales Leader
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Revenue Operations, Account Executives, Marketing

### Trigger Event
Pipeline shortfall; new SDR team or headcount; conversion/response rates below target; "we need more qualified opportunities"; board or exec pressure on pipeline coverage

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Inefficient prospecting leads to missed opportunities; wrong leads get attention, best prospects not engaged when it matters
- Low response-to-opportunity rates; manual research and follow-up don't scale
- Pipeline reviews are slow and not data-driven; lack of clear next steps per lead/account
- Hard to prioritize which accounts and leads to work first; hot leads go cold

### Desired State (After)
- Predictable pipeline; 254% more opportunities (Forrester TEI); 60% increase in response-to-opportunity rate
- Scale personalized engagement with AI and account agents; find right buyers, know what they care about, reach out at the right time
- 50% faster, more thorough pipeline reviews; data-driven decisions and quick action with agents that turn research and CRM signals into actionable steps
- Full pipeline visibility; evaluate health and track week-to-week changes; focus on hottest accounts and leads

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Cadence (pipelines, nurture, Buyer Identification Agent, cadence frameworks, A/B testing, multi-channel)
- **Supporting**: Rhythm (prioritization, Focus Zones), AI agents (account/person research, Ask Salesloft, email), Conversations (sentiment, objections, action items), Deals (pipeline view, at-risk opportunities)

### Solution Overview
Cadence takes the guesswork out of pipeline generation and lead nurture. AI and account agents prioritize the right buyers and personalize every message; Rhythm translates buyer signals into prioritized actions so reps focus on the hottest accounts. Conversations surface sentiment and objections for quick action; Deals and Forecast give single-view pipeline health and AI-driven predictions. Agents turn research and CRM signals into clear next steps for every deal.

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Cadence with best-practice cadence frameworks; connect CRM and key data sources
2. Enable Buyer Identification and account/person research agents; configure Rhythm and Focus Zones for prioritization
3. Roll out Conversations for call insights and action items; connect to Deals for pipeline visibility
4. Train on AI-drafted emails, content integrations, and A/B testing; run pipeline reviews from Deals and Forecast
