# Use Case: Team Productivity & Performance

## Overview
Revenue teams need to increase efficiency and effectiveness — less admin, more selling and coaching; clear prioritization so reps and managers focus on the highest-impact actions. This use case addresses manual tasks, tool-switching, unclear focus, and the need to scale productivity without proportionally scaling headcount.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B with revenue teams (sales, CS, RevOps); professional services, manufacturing, tech, medical
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; teams that feel "buried in admin" or "swivel-chairing" between tools
- **Characteristics**: Multiple tools for cadence, CRM, calls, deal management; desire for one workflow and less manual work

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Front Line Sellers (SDR, AE), Sales Leader, Revenue Operations
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Customer Success, Marketing

### Trigger Event
Rep productivity initiative; "we need to do more with the same headcount"; pipeline review or forecast process too time-consuming; new sales leader focused on efficiency; tool consolidation

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Reps spend significant time on research, CRM updates, summaries, and follow-up emails instead of selling
- Pipeline and deal reviews are manual and repetitive; "Deals tab cut our pipeline review time by half" (Beam) implies prior pain
- Unclear where to focus; hot leads go cold; valuable time lost on non-selling activities and tool-switching
- Coaching is deprioritized or manual; managers don't have scorecards and insights in workflow

### Desired State (After)
- Cut the busywork: automation and AI agents turn hours of research and updates into seconds
- One workflow: Rhythm prioritizes the highest-value actions; Focus Zones align seller time with top priorities
- Pipeline review time cut by half; forecast and deal visibility in real time
- Coaching in workflow: AI scorecards, key moments, and action items surface in manager's Rhythm so feedback is timely

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Rhythm (prioritization, Signals, Plays, Focus Zones), AI Agents (research, summaries, email, next steps)
- **Supporting**: Cadence (automation, capture), Deals (single view, AI next steps), Conversations (scorecards, action items), Command Center (holistic view)

### Solution Overview
Rhythm brings buyer signals into one place and the Prioritizer AI Agent translates them into a prioritized workflow per seller. Automation rules and AI agents handle research, summaries, and CRM sync so reps focus on closing. Deals and Command Center give real-time visibility; Conversations surfaces coachable moments and scorecards in workflow. Result: 20% reduction in cycle time, 25% increase in close rates, 39% decrease in activities to schedule a meeting (Rhythm page); pipeline review time cut by half (Beam).

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Rhythm and connect signals (CRM, platform, optional third-party); configure Focus Zones and Plays
2. Enable AI agents for account/person research, summaries, action items, deal summaries; train reps on workflow
3. Roll out Deals for single view and Forecast for accuracy; integrate into Rhythm workflow
4. Enable Conversations and Command Center for managers; surface scorecards and coaching prompts in Rhythm
