# Use Case: Technology & Workflow Optimization

## Overview
Revenue organizations need to unlock the power of their tech stack — consolidate point tools, unify data and workflows, and reduce "swivel-chairing" so teams work from one platform. This use case addresses scattered data, siloed systems, manual processes, and the cost and complexity of running multiple sales, marketing, and CS tools.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B with a material revenue tech stack; often mid-market to enterprise post-scale-up or post-acquisition
- **Size**: Teams using multiple tools for engagement, intelligence, deal management, forecast, chat, or CS
- **Characteristics**: Desire to consolidate; need for one source of truth, aligned teams, and governance without heavy engineering

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Operations, Sales Leader, CRO
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, IT

### Trigger Event
Tech stack consolidation or cost initiative; "one source of truth" or "align revenue" mandate; missed quarter attributed to misalignment or tool sprawl; M&A or new product line requiring unified GTM; board or exec ask for single view of pipeline and forecast

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Scattered data across CRM, engagement, intelligence, deal, forecast, chat, and CS tools; no single view of buying signals and funnel
- Siloed teams; handoffs incomplete; duplicate or conflicting touchpoints; "who owns the number?" debates
- Repetitive deal reviews and manual forecasting; risks spotted too late; workflows inconsistent across tools
- Governance and compliance require trade-offs: either loose (risk) or heavy (productivity drop, engineering dependency)
- Cost of multiple point tools and support; swivel-chairing and context loss

### Desired State (After)
- One Revenue Orchestration Platform: Cadence, Rhythm, Conversations, Deals, Forecast, Drift, Analytics, AI agents in one workflow
- Unified data model; aligned teams; decisions backed by holistic, enterprise-grade AI and data model
- Harness and consolidate full revenue stack with 180+ integrations; no-code CRM, low-code iPaaS; no engineering required
- Industry's fastest time to ROI; meaningful productivity, deal visibility, and pipeline action within first 10 days
- Confidently govern GTM with enterprise-grade controls and role-based granularity; Trust Center

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Full Salesloft platform (Cadence, Rhythm, Conversations, Deals, Forecast, Drift, Analytics, AI Agents)
- **Supporting**: 180+ integrations; automation rules; cross-platform analytics; Command Center; Trust Center

### Solution Overview
Salesloft unifies previously disconnected technologies across the entire buyer-seller journey. One platform connects your revenue tech ecosystem: CRM, conferencing, dialer, email, calendar, mobile — with governance, scale, and AI controls. Data is unified, teams are aligned, and decisions are backed by one holistic model. AI agents and workflows are embedded in the revenue workflow. Result: $350k sales tech stack savings (Wrike); "one-stop-shop platform" (3M); "more visibility into what our teams are doing" (Wrike); meaningful results in 10 days.

### Implementation Steps

2. Deploy Salesloft and connect CRM and critical systems via 180+ integrations (no-code/low-code); unify buying signals
3. Roll out Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Forecast, and Drift (as needed) so each function works from same platform
4. Enable AI agents and automation rules; configure governance and role provisioning; run cross-functional reviews from one platform
