# Use Case: Opportunity Acceleration & Management

## Overview
Revenue teams need to move deals faster and win more — with clarity on where every deal stands, what's at risk, and what needs to happen next. This use case addresses misaligned selling teams, time wasted on dead-end deals, incomplete or disconnected deal data, and forecast surprises.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B with complex or high-volume deal motion; professional services, manufacturing, tech
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise; AEs and managers with many opportunities; need for deal and forecast visibility
- **Characteristics**: Use CRM for deals; often lack single view of risk, next steps, and buying group; forecast process manual or inconsistent

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Account Executive, Sales Leader, Revenue Operations
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Development (handoff), Customer Success (expansion/renewal)

### Trigger Event
Missed forecast or surprise deal loss; "we need to close more, faster"; deal reviews too long or incomplete; new sales leader or push to improve win rate; need for multi-threaded selling and buying group visibility

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Misaligned teams: no shared view of critical deal data; tasks and next steps not assigned in workflow
- Time wasted on deals that won't close; every deal feels like a priority; stalled opportunities identified too late
- Incomplete, disconnected data; siloed systems or scattered context; manual CRM updates
- Forecast surprises; deal risk (pricing, competition, stalled activity) surfaces at end of quarter or after the fact

### Desired State (After)
- Work smarter, close faster, win more: one place to manage opportunities and see what needs attention
- AI agents spotlight deals most likely to win and flag risks before they become roadblocks; stalled-deal analysis and recommended actions in workflow
- Complete, real-time view of every opportunity; automatic CRM sync; AI Forecast for pipeline prediction
- Deal Summary AI Agent and shared dashboards; managers coach to close with deal gaps and next steps visible

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Deals (Close Focus Zone, Auto Buying Group Capture, Deal Qualification Frameworks, Deal Analytics Overview, Deals Flow chart)
- **Supporting**: Rhythm (prioritized actions, Close Focus Zone), Conversations (key moments, methodology extraction), Forecast (AI, real-time data), AI agents (Deal Summary, stalled deals, qualification)

### Solution Overview
Deals gives sellers and managers the clarity and focus to win. Close Focus Zone and account planning agents prioritize deals most likely to close. Auto Buying Group Capture ensures every email/meeting recipient is in CRM and associated with the deal. Sales Methodology Extraction AI Agent pulls MEDDPICC, BANT, SPIN from conversations. Deal Analytics Overview and Deals Flow chart provide pipeline view and conversion insights. AI agents identify stalled opportunities, show why they're stuck, and drive the right actions in Rhythm. Forecast uses past and current data to improve accuracy. Result: 2.5x faster close (3M); "gamechanger" for AEs managing many deals (customer quotes).

### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Deals and connect to CRM; enable Auto Buying Group Capture and deal qualification frameworks
2. Configure Close Focus Zone and Rhythm so prioritization surfaces in seller workflow
3. Enable Conversations and methodology extraction (MEDDPICC etc.); link key moments to deals
4. Roll out Forecast and Deal Analytics; run deal and forecast reviews from Command Center and Deals
