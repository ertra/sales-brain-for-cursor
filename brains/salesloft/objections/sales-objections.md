# Salesloft - Sales (SDR, AE, Sales Leader) Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from sales leaders, SDRs, and AEs when evaluating Salesloft — and how to handle them with proof points and messaging tailored to pipeline, productivity, and closing.

## Objections

### 1. "Our reps won't adopt another tool"

**Why They Say This**:
Reps are already in CRM and other tools; change fatigue; fear of more data entry or complexity.

**Acknowledge**:
"Adoption is always a concern when you're asking reps to change how they work."

**Respond**:
"Salesloft is built so reps live in one place — Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, and Conversations in one workflow. We hear the opposite of 'another tool': reps say they're choosing not to go into Salesforce anymore because they can do everything from Salesloft. Rhythm gives them one prioritized list so they're not juggling spreadsheets or forgetting follow-ups. And we're built for fast adoption — meaningful results in the first 10 days. I can share how Beam got pipeline review time cut in half and reps focused on the right actions. Would it help to talk to a customer in a similar role or team size?"

**Proof Point**:
- "Cadences, the ability to book meetings directly from Salesloft — [reps] can do everything from Salesloft and are choosing not to even go into Salesforce anymore sometimes." — Jules Malêtre, Sales Operations Manager
- "Rhythm doesn't let me forget to follow up with my buyers. It keeps me focused and helps me close the deal. It's a game changer." — Shane McEnany, Sr. Account Manager, Moody's Analytics
- Meaningful results in 10 days; one workflow (Cadence, Rhythm, Deals)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where do your reps spend most of their day today — and what would one prioritized list and one place for pipeline and deals mean for them?"

### 2. "We already have outreach / sequences"

**Why They Say This**:
Existing sales engagement tool; don't see need for "another" cadence product; or locked into current vendor.

**Acknowledge**:
"If you have sequences working, that's a foundation."

**Respond**:
"The difference isn't just cadence — it's prioritization and the rest of the workflow in one place. With Rhythm, every cadence step and every deal sits in one prioritized list so reps know what to do next and hot leads don't go cold. Plus Deals and Conversations mean pipeline review and coaching happen in the same workflow, and we often see pipeline review time cut in half. So the question is: do you want cadence only, or cadence plus prioritization, deal visibility, and conversation insights in one workflow? And do you need results in 10 days? I'm happy to show Rhythm and Deals so you can see the difference."

**Proof Point**:
- Beam: "Deals tab cut our pipeline review time by half"
- Rhythm: 20% reduction cycle time, 25% increase close rates, 39% decrease activities to schedule meeting
- Forrester TEI: 254% more opportunities, 60% response-to-opportunity, 50% faster pipeline reviews
- "I couldn't do my job without Salesloft. It's just an absolute powerhouse for sellers." — IDeaS

**Follow-Up Question**:
"When your reps prioritize their day, do they get one list from one system — or do they pull from multiple places?"

### 3. "Pipeline review is fine the way it is"

**Why They Say This**:
Don't see pain; or assume it's always been slow; or haven't seen a better way.

**Acknowledge**:
"Pipeline review is one of those things that can feel 'just how it is.'"

**Respond**:
"One of our customers said the same — and then they cut pipeline review time in half with the Deals tab and got much tighter around their forecast. So it's not that we're saying your process is broken; we're saying there's a way to get to the same (or better) outcome in half the time, with deal risk and next steps visible in one place. That time goes back to selling and coaching. Would it be useful to see a quick before/after of how Deals and Rhythm work in a typical review?"

**Proof Point**:
- Beam: "The Deals tab has cut our pipeline review time by half. We're able to get much tighter around what our forecast actually looks like." — Kelly North, VP of Sales
- Deals: real-time views, AI next steps, risk flagged; single view

**Follow-Up Question**:
"How long does pipeline or deal review take today — and what would cutting that in half free up for your team?"

---

### 4. "We need to see ROI before we commit"

**Why They Say This**:
Finance or exec requirement; been burned before; or need ammo for internal sell.

**Acknowledge**:
"ROI is the right bar — and you need numbers you can take to your boss or finance."

**Respond**:
"We have proof points you can use: 3M closes deals 2.5x faster, Wrike saved $350k on their sales tech stack and drove more revenue, NFP generated over $1M in revenue from using Salesloft, and Beam cut pipeline review time in half. Forrester did a Total Economic Impact study — 254% more opportunities, 60% increase in response-to-opportunity rate, 50% faster and more thorough pipeline reviews for a composite organization over three years. We also emphasize 10-day time to value so you don't wait a year to see impact. I can share a one-pager or ROI frame tailored to what your leadership cares about most. What would they need to see?"

**Proof Point**:
- 3M: 2.5x faster close
- Wrike: $350k savings, more revenue
- NFP: Over $1M revenue
- Beam: pipeline review cut by half
- Forrester TEI (April 2025): 254%, 60%, 50% faster reviews
- 10-day time to value

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What ROI metrics does your leadership care about most — pipeline, time saved, or revenue per rep?"

---

### 5. "Our forecast process is separate"

**Why They Say This**:
Forecast owned by RevOps or finance; don't see connection to engagement or deals; or use spreadsheets/other tool.

**Acknowledge**:
"Forecast is often owned by a different team or process."

**Respond**:
"That's exactly why having Deals and Forecast in the same platform as Cadence and Rhythm helps. When deal data and activity live in one place, forecast gets tighter and you're not rekeying or reconciling. One of our customers said they're now 'much tighter around what our forecast actually looks like' after using Deals. So it's not about replacing your forecast process — it's about feeding it with real-time deal visibility and AI so the number is more accurate and you see risk earlier. Would it help to show how Deals and Forecast connect to your current cadence and pipeline?"

**Proof Point**:
- Beam: "We're able to get much tighter around what our forecast actually looks like" (with Deals)
- Forecast: real-time deal data, AI, integrate into seller workflow
- Deals: single view, risks, next steps; feeds forecast

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where does forecast data come from today — and how often do you find out a deal is at risk after it's too late?"
