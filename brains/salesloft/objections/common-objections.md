# Salesloft - Common Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections across revenue leaders, RevOps, sales, marketing, and customer success — and how to handle them with Salesloft-specific proof and positioning.

## Objections

### 1. Price/Budget: "We don't have the budget" / "This is expensive"

**Why They Say This**:
Value isn't clear relative to cost; not a priority this cycle; or genuine budget constraint. Sometimes "we have other tools" = budget is spread across point solutions.

**Acknowledge**:
"Budget is always a consideration, especially when you're managing multiple tools and headcount."

**Respond**:
"Many of our customers see payback quickly — we're known for meaningful results in the first 10 days and industry's fastest time to ROI. Plus consolidation often pays for itself: Wrike saved $350k on their sales tech stack and drove more revenue with one platform. NFP generated over $1M in revenue from using Salesloft. So the question is often whether you can afford to keep spending on multiple point tools and another quarter of pipeline review time, missed follow-ups, or scattered data. I can share an ROI frame that fits your world — pipeline review time cut by half, 2.5x faster close, or the cost of one missed deal. What would make this a no-brainer for your board or finance?"

**Proof Point**:
- Wrike: $350k sales tech stack savings, more revenue; "more visibility into what our teams are doing"
- NFP: Over $1M revenue from using Salesloft
- 3M: Close deals 2.5x faster
- Beam: Pipeline review time cut by half
- Forrester TEI: 254% more opportunities, 60% response-to-opportunity, 50% faster pipeline reviews (composite org)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What would need to be true for this to be a clear yes from a budget perspective — and who else needs to be aligned on that?"

---

### 2. Timing: "Not the right time" / "Let's revisit next quarter"

**Why They Say This**:
Other priorities (CRM migration, reorg, quarter end); not urgent enough; or avoiding the decision. Sometimes they're in a long evaluation with another vendor.

**Acknowledge**:
"Timing is always a factor — and you know your calendar better than I do."

**Respond**:
"The cost of waiting is usually another quarter of the same: pipeline review taking twice as long as it could, hot leads going cold, or forecast and deal risk surfacing too late. We're built for fast time to value — meaningful productivity, deal visibility, and pipeline action within the first 10 days. So even a focused pilot can prove value quickly. What would need to shift for this to become a priority in the next 90 days?"

**Proof Point**:
- Meaningful results in first 10 days (company and platform messaging)
- Industry's fastest time to ROI
- Beam: "Deals tab cut our pipeline review time by half" — quick win
- Pilot: start with Cadence + Rhythm or Deals; expand once value is clear

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's on the roadmap for the next two quarters that might make this the right time — or that we could align with?"

---

### 3. Competition: "We're looking at Gong / Outreach"

**Why They Say This**:
Doing due diligence; existing relationship; or they see value in an alternative (intelligence depth, engagement maturity, etc.).

**Acknowledge**:
"They're serious players. It's smart to compare."

**Respond**:
"The key differentiator for us is full Revenue Orchestration in one workflow — including Drift for website conversion, which neither Gong nor Outreach offer in the same platform. We also lead with 10-day time to value and Rhythm: reps get one prioritized list from buyer signals so nothing falls through the cracks. So the question is: do you need website-to-pipeline in the same vendor, do you want results in 10 days, and do you want one workflow (Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Forecast, Drift) instead of layering intelligence on top of something else? We win when full workflow and time to value matter. I'm happy to do a focused comparison on the 2–3 things that matter most to you."

**Proof Point**:
- Drift: only Salesloft has AI chat and website conversion in the same platform
- 10-day time to value; industry's fastest time to ROI
- 5,000+ customers; 3M, Wrike, NFP, Beam proof points
- Rhythm + Focus Zones: "Rhythm doesn't let me forget to follow up with my buyers. It's a game changer." (customer)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"What's the single most important outcome — pipeline coverage, time to value, website conversion, or something else?"

### 4. Status Quo: "We're fine with what we have" / "We already have sales engagement"

**Why They Say This**:
Change is hard; they don't see the problem; or they're comfortable with current tools (e.g. existing engagement, CRM, spreadsheets).

**Acknowledge**:
"If what you have is working, that's a good place to be."

**Respond**:
"Many of our customers thought the same — and then they saw pipeline review time cut in half, or 2.5x faster close, or $350k saved by consolidating. The gap we see is usually one of three: hot leads going cold because follow-up isn't prioritized, pipeline and forecast visibility taking too long, or marketing and sales still on different systems so website visitors don't become pipeline in the same workflow. I'm not saying you have to change today — but what would 'better' look like? Even one of those — like one prioritized list so reps never forget to follow up — can be a quick win. What would need to be true for you to consider consolidating or adding prioritization and deal visibility?"

**Proof Point**:
- Beam: thought they had deal visibility; "Deals tab cut our pipeline review time by half"
- 3M: "one-stop-shop platform that offered solutions to a variety of our needs"
- Wrike: "more visibility into what our teams are doing"
- Rhythm: "doesn't let me forget to follow up" (Shane McEnany, Moody's Analytics)

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Where do your reps live day to day — one system or several? And when a hot lead comes in, how do you make sure it doesn't go cold?"

---

### 5. Authority: "I need to check with my boss / RevOps / team"

**Why They Say This**:
Genuine need for buy-in; or using as delay tactic. Sometimes budget or evaluation process isn't clear.

**Acknowledge**:
"Getting alignment is important — especially for a platform that touches so many teams."

**Respond**:
"We're happy to help you make the case. We have ROI and proof points that work well with finance and execs: 10-day time to value, Wrike $350k savings, 3M 2.5x faster close, NFP $1M+ revenue, and Forrester TEI for pipeline creation. We can put together a one-pager or ROI frame tailored to what your boss or RevOps care about most — consolidation savings, pipeline coverage, or forecast visibility. Who else is in the decision process, and what would they need to see to get to yes?"

**Proof Point**:
- ROI calculator and resources on site
- Forrester TEI (April 2025): composite org, three years; 254%, 60%, 50% faster reviews
- Customer quotes from VP Sales (Beam), Director (3M), SVP (NFP), Business Transformation (Wrike)
- Trust Center, compliance, platform status for security/legal

**Follow-Up Question**:
"Who else needs to be in the room for this decision — and what would make it an easy yes for them?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "When you think about budget for revenue tools, are you looking to consolidate or add? What's the total spend today?"
2. "What's your timeline for making a change — this quarter, next quarter, or just exploring?"
3. "Who's involved in the decision — RevOps, sales leader, marketing, finance?"
4. "What are you using today for engagement, pipeline, and deal visibility — and what would 'better' look like?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're just looking" with no timeline or next step
- No champion; only economic buyer or only end user in the conversation
- Evaluation driven only by feature checklist without outcome (pipeline, time to value, consolidation)
- Competitor already in pilot or strong incumbent (Outreach/Gong) with no stated pain
