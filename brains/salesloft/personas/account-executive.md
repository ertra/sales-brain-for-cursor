# Account Executive (Front Line Seller)

## Role/Title
Account Executives (AEs), front line sellers. Own closing deals, building strong customer relationships, and hitting quota. Sell smarter, close faster.

## Responsibilities
- Meet buyers where they are; maximize productivity and achieve repeatable success with AI agents
- Prioritize accounts that will convert; connect with buyers in meaningful ways
- Hyper-personalize every engagement; understand accounts and buyers without hours of manual research
- Progress deals without slowing down; get context and next steps in workflow, not from scattered tools
- Automate busywork so more time goes to strategic, human-to-human impact

## Company Profile
B2B sales orgs; inside, field, or hybrid. Reps often have many accounts and deals; need one platform to prospect, close, and delight buyers. Use CRM and often multiple tools; want clarity and less context-switching.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Forgetting to follow up; hot leads go cold; no clear prioritization of actions
- Hours of manual research for personalization; generic messaging
- Time spent gathering context instead of closing; information not at fingertips
- Busywork (research, emails, data entry) takes time from selling

## Goals & Objectives
- Crush quota with everything needed in one platform
- Prioritize accounts that will convert; connect in meaningful ways using real-time buyer signals
- Hyper-personalize every engagement with research briefs and smart generative emails

- Automate busywork so team can invest in strategic, human-to-human impact
