# Revenue Operations (RevOps)

## Role/Title
Revenue Operations leaders and practitioners (RevOps, Sales Operations, Business Transformation). Own alignment of sales and success on a unified platform, tech stack strategy, and predictable revenue outcomes.

## Responsibilities
- Align teams and grow revenue on a unified, efficient platform
- Harness and consolidate the full revenue stack; unify buying signals and activate data
- Untangle revenue complexities; show gaps and opportunities across the full funnel in one place
- Plan for future revenue growth; eliminate repetitive deal reviews, spot risks, execute confidently with forecast
- Create consistency with workflows; instill best practices, drive repeatable revenue
- Govern go-to-market initiatives with enterprise-grade controls and role-based provisioning

## Company Profile
B2B organizations from mid-market to enterprise; revenue teams that want one platform instead of point tools. Often have CRM, engagement tools, and multiple data sources; need consolidation and AI-driven workflows without heavy engineering (no-code CRM, low-code iPaaS, partner ecosystem).

## Key Problems & Pain Points

## Buying Process
RevOps often leads or heavily influences platform selection. Evaluation focuses on consolidation ROI, time to value, governance, and alignment with existing CRM and tech stack. Proof from similar orgs (e.g. Wrike visibility quote) resonates.

## Communication Preferences
"Optimize performance. Produce results." Align team and grow revenue on a unified platform. Visibility, consistency, governance. Best practices and actionable insights (e.g. RevOps Leadership Handbook, State of Revenue Engagement, Tech Stack Consolidation guide).
