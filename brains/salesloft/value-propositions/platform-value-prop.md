# Salesloft Revenue Orchestration Platform → Platform Value Proposition

## Summary
Salesloft is the leading AI Revenue Orchestration Platform. It unifies AI chat (Drift), sales engagement (Cadence), conversation intelligence (Conversations), deal management (Deals), forecasting (Forecast), and analytics in one workflow — all supported by purpose-built AI agents. Revenue teams prioritize and take action on what matters most: smarter execution, more qualified pipeline, and faster deal cycles. Result: durable revenue growth with meaningful productivity and pipeline action within the first 10 days, trusted by 5,000+ customers including 3M, Stripe, IBM, and Wrike.

## The Problem
Revenue teams are stuck with guesswork and broken workflows: scattered data, siloed tools, and manual processes. Pipeline is inconsistent; deal risk surfaces too late; coaching isn’t tied to what wins. Reps waste time on admin and follow-up; leaders lack real-time visibility; marketing and sales are disconnected. Taking the right actions won’t happen without one place that turns insights into action.

## The Solution
One Revenue Orchestration Platform: Cadence for pipeline and nurture, Rhythm for prioritization and actions, Conversations for coaching and insights, Deals for opportunity clarity, Forecast for the number, Drift for website-to-pipeline, and AI agents embedded throughout. Every market-facing team works from the same data and the same workflow — with governance, scale, and industry’s fastest time to ROI.
