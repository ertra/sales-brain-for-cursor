# Salesloft → Revenue Operations Value Proposition

## Summary
Salesloft gives RevOps one platform to align teams and grow revenue: unified data and workflows, AI-driven insights that prompt the right actions, and governance without sacrificing productivity. Consolidate the full revenue stack with 180+ integrations and no-code/low-code; untangle complexity with funnel visibility and agent-prompted actions; plan with AI Forecast and real-time deal views. Result: optimize performance, produce results, and confidently govern GTM.

## The Problem
RevOps battles scattered data and siloed teams; no single view of buying signals and funnel. Repetitive deal reviews and manual forecasting; risks spotted too late. Workflows are inconsistent; best practices don’t scale. Governing GTM (role-based access, compliance) often means trading off productivity or engineering effort.

## The Solution
One Revenue Orchestration Platform that harnesses and consolidates the full revenue stack: Rhythm for prioritization and plays, Forecast for accuracy and workflow integration, Deals for real-time views and alignment, Cadence for repeatable plays, automation rules and cross-platform analytics. AI insights show gaps and opportunity and prompt actions in rep workflow; enterprise-grade governance with granular provisioning.
