# Salesloft → Sales (SDR, AE, Sales Leader) Value Proposition

## Summary
Salesloft gives sales teams one platform to build pipeline, take the right actions, and close with confidence. Cadence and Rhythm remove guesswork from prospecting and prioritization; AI agents cut research and admin so reps focus on selling. Leaders get deal visibility and coaching insights in workflow — pipeline review time cut by half, forecast tighter. Result: predictable pipeline, faster close, and reps who don’t let hot leads go cold.

## The Problem
SDRs and AEs face inefficient prospecting, manual research, and unclear prioritization; hot leads go cold when follow-up slips. Pipeline and deal reviews are manual and time-consuming; forecast and risk surface too late. Managers coach without objective view of what wins; admin crowds out selling time.

## The Solution
Cadence for pipeline and nurture with AI and account agents; Rhythm for prioritization so the right actions surface in one workflow; Conversations for coaching and call insights; Deals for clarity and risk; AI agents for research, email, and next steps. Everything in one place — including Mobile — so reps prospect and close from anywhere.
