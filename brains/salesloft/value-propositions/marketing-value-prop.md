# Salesloft (Drift) → Marketing Value Proposition

## Summary
Salesloft gives marketing one platform to convert website visitors into qualified pipeline and align with sales. Drift AI chat agents deliver real-time personalization, deanonymize visitors, and route high-intent buyers into the seller’s workflow with context. Sync cadences to campaigns; attribute success to pipeline and revenue. Result: hit pipeline goals, improve the buying experience, and connect marketing and sales on the same Revenue Orchestration Platform.

## The Problem
Marketing can’t meet buyer expectations on the website — generic forms and slow follow-up cause drop-off. Traffic is anonymous; intent is invisible. High-intent visitors aren’t handed to sales with context, so cycles are long and handoff is broken. It’s hard to prove which experiences convert and to align with sales.

## The Solution
Drift: AI chat agents for real-time personalized conversations, meeting booking, and live rep handoff. Deanonymize visitors and score engagement; use buyer signals and prioritization to target the right accounts. Route qualified buyers into Rhythm as prioritized actions with context. ROI reporting ties engagement to pipeline and revenue. Same platform as sales — cadences sync to campaigns; one data model.
