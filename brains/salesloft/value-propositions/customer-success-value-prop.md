# Salesloft → Customer Success Value Proposition

## Summary
Salesloft gives Customer Success one platform to deliver value, earn loyalty, and protect revenue. Cadence runs personalized multi-touch campaigns for onboarding, adoption, renewals, and expansions — powered by generative AI. Conversations and Deals provide visibility into health and risk; Forecast and prioritization agents spot churn and growth opportunities. Result: reduce churn, create champions, and close more renewals with automations that scale, on the same platform as sales.

## The Problem
CS teams discover churn too late; mitigation is reactive and manual. Engagement is inconsistent and hard to personalize at scale. Growth opportunities and next best actions aren’t visible; renewals and critical touchpoints don’t scale. Customer health and deal risk live in scattered systems.

## The Solution
Cadence for customer-facing campaigns (onboarding, adoption, renewals, expansions) with AI-personalized touches; Conversations for real-time insights and follow-up; Forecast for renewals, churn, and expansions; Deals for visibility into renewals, upgrades, and risks. Account prioritization agents analyze signals to anticipate next moves; automations scale critical touchpoints.
