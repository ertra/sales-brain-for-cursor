# Sales Play: New Sales Leader (Pipeline & Forecast Visibility)

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | New Sales Leader — Pipeline & Forecast Visibility |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Leader (VP Sales, Director), Revenue Operations |
| **Target Company** | B2B sales orgs with new sales leader or push to improve pipeline review, forecast, and coaching |
| **Products** | Deals, Rhythm, Conversations, Forecast, Command Center, Cadence |
| **Trigger Event** | New VP/Director of Sales; missed forecast; "we need to cut pipeline review time" or "get tighter on the number" |
| **Play Type** | Inbound / Outbound |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- New sales leader hired (first 90 days often open to tool change)
- Missed quarter or forecast surprise; need for deal visibility and risk earlier
- "Pipeline review takes too long"; "we need to get tighter around our forecast"
- Coaching and rep performance initiative; want scorecards and insights in workflow

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Recent sales leadership change
- Pipeline or deal review process manual and time-consuming
- Forecast accuracy or "owning the number" is a priority
- Desire to coach with data; objection handling and stalled-deal visibility

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | Mid-market to enterprise |
| Need | Pipeline/forecast visibility; coaching; time back for leadership |
| Budget | Platform-level; ROI from time saved and forecast accuracy |

## The Play

### Objective
Win when a new sales leader (or incumbent) wants to cut pipeline review time, get tighter on forecast, and coach with data — with proof that Deals and Conversations in workflow deliver (Beam: pipeline review cut by half; 3M: 2.5x faster close).

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Cut pipeline review time in half and get much tighter on your forecast — with one place for deals, risk, and coaching. Beam did it with our Deals tab; 3M closes 2.5x faster. Scorecards and key moments surface in your managers' workflow so you coach to close without leaving the platform."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify new sales leader (LinkedIn, press); note start date and stated priorities
- Understand current pipeline review and forecast process; who owns the number
- Find RevOps or ops contact; check current tools (CRM, engagement, CI)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How long do pipeline and deal reviews take today — and what would cutting that in half free up for your team?
2. When do you usually find out a deal is at risk or stalled — and what would you need to see it earlier?
3. How do managers today get the insights they need to coach — and are scorecards and feedback in the workflow?
4. How do you run forecast today — and how accurate and timely is it?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Deals** — single view, real-time; Close Focus Zone; pipeline review in one place; Beam: "cut our pipeline review time by half"
2. **Forecast** — AI, real-time data; integrate into seller workflow; "much tighter around what our forecast actually looks like"
3. **Conversations + Command Center** — scorecards, key moments, coaching prompts in Rhythm; holistic view and deal risk
4. **Rhythm** — prioritization for reps and managers; right actions at the right time

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case studies**: Beam (pipeline review half, forecast tighter), 3M (2.5x faster close)
- **Use case**: [team-productivity-performance.md](../use-cases/team-productivity-performance.md), [opportunity-acceleration-management.md](../use-cases/opportunity-acceleration-management.md)

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "Our reps won't adopt another tool" | "Reps live in one place — Cadence, Rhythm, Deals. We hear they choose not to go into Salesforce because they can do everything from Salesloft. Results in 10 days." |
| "Pipeline review is fine the way it is" | "One customer said the same — then cut pipeline review time in half with the Deals tab and got much tighter on forecast. Same or better outcome in half the time." |
| "We need to see ROI" | "Beam cut pipeline review time in half; 3M closes 2.5x faster. We can share a one-pager or ROI frame for your leadership." |
