## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- "We want to consolidate our sales/revenue tech stack"
- New RevOps or CRO; "align revenue" or "one source of truth" mandate
- Missed quarter attributed to misalignment or tool sprawl
- Board or exec ask for single view of pipeline and forecast
- Renewals coming up for multiple point tools

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Using 3+ tools for engagement, intelligence, deals, forecast, or chat
- RevOps or sales leader recently hired; consolidation on roadmap
- Visibility and consistency pain; "we have too many places to look"
- Wrike/3M-style profile: need visibility + savings + one platform

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | Mid-market to enterprise |
| Current State | Multiple revenue tools; desire to reduce complexity and cost |
| Budget | Can reallocate from point tools; ROI from consolidation |

## The Play

### Objective
Win when RevOps or leadership wants one platform for pipeline, deals, forecast, engagement, and (optionally) website conversion — with 10-day time to value and proof that consolidation pays (e.g. Wrike $350k savings, 3M one-stop-shop).

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"One Revenue Orchestration Platform: Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Forecast, Drift, and AI agents in one workflow. Meaningful results in 10 days. Wrike saved $350k and got more visibility; 3M uses us as a one-stop-shop. 180+ integrations, no engineering required."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Map prospect's current stack (engagement, CI, deal, forecast, chat); estimate cost and overlap
- Identify RevOps and sales leader; understand "one source of truth" or visibility pain
- Check for consolidation or cost initiative in the open

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. How many tools does your revenue team use day to day — and where does "source of truth" live for pipeline and forecast?
2. How much are you spending on sales/marketing/CS tools combined — and what would consolidation save?
3. How do you today identify gaps and opportunities across the funnel — and do reps get prompted to act in one place?
4. What would "one platform" mean for your pipeline reviews, forecast process, and cross-team alignment?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Platform overview** — Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Forecast, Drift, Analytics, AI agents in one workflow
2. **Visibility** — one view of pipeline, deals, forecast; Wrike: "more visibility into what our teams are doing"; "sellers have visibility into deals they have never had access to before"
3. **Integrations** — 180+; no-code CRM, low-code iPaaS; no engineering required
4. **10-day time to value** — meaningful results in first 10 days; industry's fastest time to ROI

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case studies**: Wrike ($350k savings, visibility), 3M (one-stop-shop, 2.5x faster close)
- **Use case**: [technology-workflow-optimization.md](../use-cases/technology-workflow-optimization.md)

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We're not ready to consolidate" | "Many customers start with one use case (e.g. Cadence + Rhythm) and see results in 10 days, then expand. Wrike got $350k savings and more visibility when they consolidated." |
| "We need more visibility before we add another tool" | "Adding Salesloft is usually replacing multiple tools with one, not adding a silo. Wrike said they have more visibility into what their teams are doing and sellers have visibility into deals they never had before." |
| "Implementation will take too long" | "We're built for 10-day time to value. 180+ integrations, no-code/low-code — no engineering required. Wrike and 3M run on us at scale." |
