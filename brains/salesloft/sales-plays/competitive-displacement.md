# Sales Play: Competitive Displacement (vs. Gong / Outreach)

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Competitive Displacement — Gong / Outreach |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Leader, Revenue Operations, CRO |
| **Target Company** | B2B revenue orgs evaluating or using Gong or Outreach; want full workflow + time to value or website conversion |
| **Products** | Full platform (Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Forecast, Drift, AI Agents) |
| **Trigger Event** | RFP or evaluation including Gong/Outreach; incumbent renewal; need for website chat or 10-day value |
| **Play Type** | Competitive |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Prospect is evaluating Gong or Outreach (or both)
- Gong/Outreach renewal coming up; dissatisfaction with time to value or missing website conversion
- "We want one platform" but also need website-to-pipeline in same vendor
- Sales or RevOps ask for "faster time to value" or "one workflow for reps"

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Using or piloting Gong (intelligence) or Outreach (engagement); considering consolidation or switch
- Marketing and sales want website chat and conversion in same platform as sales workflow
- Pipeline review or forecast process still time-consuming; want results in days not months
- Reps use multiple tools; want one prioritized list (Rhythm)

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | Mid-market to enterprise |
| Need | Full revenue workflow; and/or website conversion; and/or 10-day time to value |
| Budget | Platform-level; consolidation often pays (Wrike $350k) |

## The Play

### Objective
Win when full Revenue Orchestration (including Drift), 10-day time to value, and one workflow (Rhythm, Deals, Conversations) matter more than data-first architecture (Gong) or engagement-only narrative (Outreach).

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Only Salesloft gives you website chat and conversion in the same platform as your sales workflow — plus meaningful results in 10 days and one prioritized list so reps never let hot leads go cold. 3M closes 2.5x faster; Wrike saved $350k; NFP drove over $1M revenue."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
- Identify whether they use or are evaluating Gong, Outreach, or both; note renewal timing
- Check if marketing/sales care about website conversion (Drift) and time to value
- Find champion (Sales Leader, RevOps); understand pain (pipeline review time, forecast, adoption)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Key questions:**
1. Do you need to convert website visitors into pipeline in the same platform as your sellers' workflow, or is that a separate tool?
2. How quickly do you need to see productivity and pipeline results — weeks or 10 days?
3. When reps prioritize their day, do they get one list from one system or pull from multiple places?
4. What's the single most important outcome — pipeline coverage, time to value, website conversion, or forecast accuracy?

### Step 3: Demo Focus
1. **Drift** — website chat and conversion; route qualified visitors to Rhythm with context (Gong/Outreach don't have this)
2. **Rhythm + Focus Zones** — one prioritized list; "right actions at the right moments"; no hot lead left behind
3. **Deals + Conversations** — pipeline review in one place; Beam: "cut our pipeline review time by half"; scorecards and key moments in workflow
4. **10-day time to value** — meaningful results in first 10 days; industry's fastest time to ROI

### Step 4: Proof & Close
- **Case studies**: 3M (2.5x faster), Wrike ($350k, visibility), NFP ($1M+), Beam (pipeline review half)
- **Battle cards**: [competitors/gong.md](../competitors/gong.md), [competitors/outreach.md](../competitors/outreach.md)

## Objection Handling

| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We're looking at Gong" | "Gong is strong on the Revenue Graph. The key question: do you need website conversion in the same platform and results in 10 days? We're the only one with Drift and 10-day value." |
| "We're looking at Outreach" | "Outreach has a strong platform. We add Drift for website conversion, 10-day time to value, and Rhythm so reps get one prioritized list. Wrike saved $350k with us; 3M closes 2.5x faster." |
| "Gong has Gartner Leader" | "We're the leading Revenue Orchestration Platform with 5,000+ customers. What matters more for you — Gartner badge or time to value and full workflow including chat?" |
