# Salesloft Sales Brain

Human-friendly overview of the Salesloft sales intelligence in this folder. For AI agents and file-level loading rules, see **INDEX.md**.

## What Is This?

This is a **Sales Brain** for **Salesloft** — a structured set of markdown files that capture company info, products, personas, pain points, value propositions, use cases, competitors, objections, case studies, and sales plays. Use it for enablement, competitive prep, and consistent messaging.

## Salesloft in One Sentence

Salesloft is the leading **AI Revenue Orchestration Platform**: one place for pipeline (Cadence), prioritization (Rhythm), conversation intelligence (Conversations), deals (Deals), forecast (Forecast), and website conversion (Drift), with purpose-built AI agents — **meaningful results in 10 days**, trusted by 5,000+ customers including 3M, Wrike, and NFP.

## Proof Points to Remember

| Customer | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **3M** | Close deals **2.5x faster**; "one-stop-shop platform" |
| **Wrike** | **$350k** sales tech stack savings; more visibility; more revenue |
| **NFP** | **Over $1M** revenue from using Salesloft; reverse-engineer activities for pipeline goals |
| **Beam** | Pipeline review time **cut by half**; much tighter forecast |
| **Forrester TEI** | 254% more opportunities; 60% response-to-opportunity; 50% faster pipeline reviews (composite org) |

## Key Differentiators

1. **Drift in the same platform** — Only Salesloft offers AI chat and website-to-pipeline in the same Revenue Orchestration Platform (Gong and Outreach don’t).
2. **10-day time to value** — Meaningful productivity, deal visibility, and pipeline action within the first 10 days; industry’s fastest time to ROI.
3. **One workflow** — Cadence, Rhythm, Deals, Conversations, Forecast, Drift, and AI agents in one place; Rhythm gives reps one prioritized list so hot leads don’t go cold.
4. **Proof at scale** — 5,000+ customers; 3M, Wrike, NFP, Beam; Forrester TEI for pipeline creation.
