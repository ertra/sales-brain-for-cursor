# Marketing (GTM / Demand)

## Role/Title
Marketing, Demand Gen, Growth Marketing, Startup Marketing — own leads, campaigns, attribution, and alignment with sales.

## Responsibilities
Generate and nurture leads; run campaigns and sequences; attribute pipeline and revenue; route and qualify leads; align with sales on definitions and handoffs; report on funnel and channels.

## Company Profile
B2B companies with a marketing function; startups to mid-market. Often share GTM stack with Sales and RevOps; care about lead quality and full-funnel visibility.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Lead and campaign data disconnected from CRM; no single view of lead → opportunity → revenue.
- Manual routing and triage; slow or inconsistent lead assignment and follow-up.
- Attribution and reporting require exports and spreadsheets; hard to “segment by” and see channel impact in real time.
- Need product and engagement signals (e.g. signups, usage) in the same place as CRM for scoring and routing.

## Goals & Objectives
Automate lead routing and triage; get full-funnel visibility in one place; attribute campaigns to pipeline and revenue; align with sales on one source of truth.

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Workflows** — MQL lead routing; lead form submissions; nurture and onboarding flows; trigger from Typeform, Segment, webhooks; route by segment (e.g. enterprise vs SMB).
- **Data model** — Unify lead, company, and product data; custom attributes for source, segment, score; activity timelines and enrichment.
- **Ask Attio** — Marketing persona tab; segment and research; “shipped feature outreach” (find customers who requested a feature, draft emails); account research.
- **Reporting** — Lead and pipeline reports; segment by channel, source, segment; historical and targets; attribution-style views when combined with deal data.

## Buying Process
Often part of GTM evaluation with Sales and RevOps; may champion if current stack doesn’t support routing, attribution, or product-led signals. Care about integrations (Segment, Mailchimp, Typeform) and automation.

## Communication Preferences
Case studies (e.g. Granola “83% faster lead triage,” product signals into revenue); automation templates (MQL routing, lead form submissions); messaging on “product signals into revenue” and single source of truth.

## Additional Notes
Ask Attio persona tabs include “Marketing.” Careers: Growth Marketing Lead (Demand), Head of Growth Marketing, Startup Marketing (San Francisco). Target-companies: PLG/PLS segments; “capture high-intent leads,” “nurture and onboarding flows.”
