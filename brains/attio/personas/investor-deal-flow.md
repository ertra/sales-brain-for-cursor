# Investor / Deal Flow

## Role/Title
Investor, Partner, Associate, Deal flow / Operations — track deals, companies, funds, and relationships in a pipeline.

## Responsibilities
Source and track deals; manage pipeline by stage; maintain company and contact data; report on deal flow and portfolio; collaborate across partners and associates; sometimes LP reporting.

## Company Profile
Venture capital, PE, investment firms. From single fund to multi-fund; small team to large partnership. Geography: global; Attio case studies include Seedcamp, USV.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Deals and companies in spreadsheets or legacy tools; no single source of truth.
- CRM built for sales, not investing — wrong objects (no Fund, Deal type, etc.) and rigid schema.
- Siloed data across partners and tools; hard to get a unified view of pipeline and relationships.
- Need to “turn siloed data into a source of truth” and “build the perfect deal engine.”

## Goals & Objectives
One system for deal flow; flexible data model (Fund, Deal, Company, Person); pipeline visibility and reporting; scale without losing speed or control.

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Data model** — Custom objects: Fund, Deal (investment amount, stage), Company, Person; build for “investors” use case; associations and attributes that match how they work.
- **Reporting** — Pipeline, stage, and portfolio views; real-time; group and drill down; historical and targets.
- **Workflows** — Automate deal and company updates; route and notify; optional AI for research and summarization.
- **Single source of truth** — “From fragmented to unified” (USV); “Investing at scale” (Seedcamp); replace spreadsheets and siloed tools.

## Buying Process
Often lead by Partner or Ops; may evaluate with a small team or single fund first. Care about flexibility, data model, and migration from current deal-tracking setup.

## Communication Preferences
Deal flow solution positioning; case studies: Seedcamp (“perfect deal engine”), USV (“siloed data into a source of truth”); “Attio for Deal flow” and custom data model messaging.
