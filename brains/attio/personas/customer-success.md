# Customer Success Manager (CS)

## Role/Title
Customer Success Manager, CS Lead — own retention, expansion, and health for post-sale accounts.

## Responsibilities
Onboard new customers; monitor health and usage; run QBRs and check-ins; identify expansion and risk; hand off from sales and coordinate with support; renewals and adoption.

## Company Profile
B2B SaaS and tech; companies with a dedicated CS function, often scale-up or mid-market. May sit in GTM or report to COO/VP Customer Success.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Context lives in sales CRM, support tools, and product — no single view of account before calls.
- Manual handoff from sales; deal context and next steps not automatically available in CS workflow.
- Renewal and health data scattered; hard to see “what’s going on” per account without digging.
- Need product engagement and usage in the same place as relationship history.

## Goals & Objectives
Show up to every customer call with full context; spot risk and expansion early; reduce manual handoffs and duplicate data entry; align with sales and product on one view of the customer.

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Ask Attio** — QBR prep, onboarding prep, product engagement summary; meeting prep and recap; account research; permissions so CS sees only their accounts.
- **Workflows** — Pass won deals to CS; renewal date autofill; churn reminders; closed-won notifications and Slack; automate handoffs and health triggers.
- **Data model** — Custom objects for health, workspaces, usage; activity timelines; enrichment so every record has company and contact context.
- **Reporting** — Health and adoption dashboards; segment by plan, usage, tenure; historical and targets.

## Buying Process
Often part of cross-functional GTM evaluation with Sales and RevOps; may champion if current CRM doesn’t support CS workflows or handoffs. Care about “single source of truth” and collaboration.

## Communication Preferences
Case studies (e.g. Flatfile “business engine,” pass deals to CS templates); messaging on handoffs, health, and “one place for GTM.”

## Additional Notes
Ask Attio persona tabs include “Success.” Automations: “Pass deals to Customer Success,” “Customer renewal date autofill,” “Stay on top of customer churn.” Startup solution quote: “from our sales pipelines to customer onboarding processes to customer success” — Taimur Abdaal, Co-Founder & CTO.
