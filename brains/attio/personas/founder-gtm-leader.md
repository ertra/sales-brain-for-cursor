# Founder / GTM Leader

## Role/Title
Founder, Co-Founder, VP/Head of Sales, VP/Head of GTM, CRO — own GTM strategy and often hands-on in pipeline, fundraising, or recruiting.

## Responsibilities
Set GTM motion (sales-led, PLG, PLS); build and iterate on pipeline, onboarding, and CS; sometimes run fundraising and recruiting in the same system; want one engine that scales from zero to IPO.

## Company Profile
Startups and scale-ups; pre–Series A through growth. Often technical or product-minded founders who want flexibility without long implementations.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- CRMs feel overcomplicated, expensive, and prescriptive — “bend to their will, not the other way around.”
- Need one system for sales, onboarding, and CS; don’t want to rip and replace every 12 months.
- Use cases span sales, fundraising, and recruiting; legacy CRM doesn’t support custom objects or fast iteration.
- Want “balance of flexibility and prescriptiveness” as an early-stage startup.

## Goals & Objectives
Build a world-class GTM engine (pipelines, onboarding, CS) in one place; iterate quickly without fighting the tool; start free and scale with the company; keep data and workflows under one roof.

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Platform** — “From zero to IPO”; real-time CRM for scaling startups; infinitely flexible; Free to start, no credit card; 14-day Pro trial.
- **Data model** — Build for any business model; custom objects (e.g. investors, partnerships); “configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around” (Margaret Shen, Modal).
- **Workflows** — Design pipelines and processes from the ground up; templates and building blocks; automate handoffs and triage (e.g. 83% faster lead triage, Granola).
- **Ask Attio** — Founders persona tab; meeting prep, deal brief, daily brief; less context-switching.

## Buying Process
May evaluate and decide directly; care about time to value, flexibility, and “does it work for sales, onboarding, and CS?” Social proof and founder/CTO quotes resonate (e.g. Jono Bacon, Taimur Abdaal, Dimitry Gershenson).

## Communication Preferences
Startup solution page, “CRM for startups,” testimonials (sales, fundraising, recruiting); messaging on flexibility, simplicity, and “nothing like it on the market” (Bravado quote). Try for free, demo, talk to sales.

## Additional Notes
Ask Attio persona tabs: “Founders.” Startup solution: “We use Attio for sales, fundraising, and recruiting” (Dimitry Gershenson). “We’ve been able to build a world-class go-to-market engine – from our sales pipelines to customer onboarding processes to customer success. There’s nothing like it in the market.” — Taimur Abdaal, Co-Founder & CTO.
