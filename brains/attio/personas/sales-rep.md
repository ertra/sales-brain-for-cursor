# Sales Rep (Account Executive / SDR)

## Role/Title
Account Executive, SDR, BDR, Sales Manager — frontline GTM roles owning pipeline, deals, and meetings.

## Responsibilities
Own pipeline and deal execution; run discovery and demos; prep for calls; update deals and next steps; run or benefit from sequences; collaborate on notes and activity; hit quota and forecast.

## Company Profile
B2B companies from startups to enterprise; SaaS, AI, tech, data/DevTools common. Teams of 1–50+ sellers; often scale-up or mid-market with dedicated sales and RevOps.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Context scattered across email, calendar, notes, Slack — slow prep and risk of missing context before calls.
- Manual deal and activity updates; CRM feels like data entry, not intelligence.
- Rigid CRM that doesn’t match how they sell (e.g. product-led, multi-workspace).
- Weak or delayed intel on deals; no single place for “everything I need to know” before a meeting.

## Goals & Objectives
Prep for every call in minutes; keep deals and next steps up to date without busywork; show up informed and close faster; stay in sync with team and leadership.

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Ask Attio** — Meeting prep, deal brief, daily brief, recap call; update deal/next step from natural language; objection handling and follow-up email drafts; permissions so they only see what they’re allowed to.
- **Workflows & sequences** — Automate routing, nurture, and follow-ups; multiple senders in one sequence; less manual outreach.
- **Data & reporting** — One source of truth; activity timelines and enrichment on every record; pipeline and deal reporting that reflects their process.
- **Flexible data model** — CRM that fits their motion (e.g. PLG, PLS) and stages.

## Buying Process
Often influenced by RevOps or GTM leader; may champion if they feel pain with current CRM. Care about speed to value, ease of use, and “does it work the way we sell?”

## Communication Preferences
Product-led try (Free/Pro trial), demos, case studies (e.g. Granola triage, Modal workflows); messaging around “prep for every call,” “real information not AI invention,” and flexibility.

## Additional Notes
Attio careers: Account Executive (New York, SF, London), Sales Manager, Solutions Engineer (Pre/Post-Sales). Ask Attio persona tabs include “Sales.” Quote: “Before every meeting, Ask Attio centralizes, summarizes, and surfaces everything I need to know…” — Ian Ahuja, Head of Sales.
