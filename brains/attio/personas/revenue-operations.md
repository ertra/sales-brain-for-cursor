# Revenue Operations (RevOps)

## Role/Title
Revenue Operations, GTM Operations, Sales Operations — own data, workflows, reporting, and system design for revenue teams.

## Responsibilities
Design and maintain CRM data model; build workflows and automations; own reporting, dashboards, and attribution; integrate stack (email, calendar, data warehouse, engagement tools); ensure single source of truth and governance.

## Company Profile
B2B scale-ups and mid-market to enterprise; SaaS, tech, high-velocity GTM. Dedicated RevOps or combined with Sales/GTM Ops; often post–Series A.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- CRM schema doesn’t match business (e.g. workspaces, product, investors); forced to work around rigid objects.
- Data silos — product, billing, and engagement data live outside CRM; no real-time single source of truth.
- Building and maintaining automations is slow or requires heavy engineering; workflows don’t support complex logic or AI.
- Reporting requires exports and external BI; hard to “group your way” and drill down in real time.

## Goals & Objectives
One CRM that reflects the business; automate GTM processes without constant custom code; give teams real-time, flexible reporting; reduce tool sprawl and sync issues.

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **Data model** — Custom objects and attributes; build for any model (PLG, deal flow, sales); associations and graph; millions of records with sub-50ms; iterate without migration hell.
- **Workflows** — Visual canvas, triggers, actions, AI blocks; integrate Outreach, Typeform, Slack, Mailchimp, Mixmax, webhooks; classify and summarize data in workflows.
- **Data & sync** — Data warehouses, reverse ETL, CDPs; email/calendar sync; enrichment on every record; “no silos.”
- **Reporting** — Real-time; group, segment, historical, targets; dashboards; collaborative; scales with data.
- **Security & admin** — Teams, permissions, SSO (Enterprise); GDPR, CCPA, ISO.

## Buying Process
Often lead evaluator or key stakeholder; care about data model flexibility, API/webhooks, migration path (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel). May run PoC on Free/Plus then scale to Pro/Enterprise.

## Communication Preferences
Technical and product content; automation templates, developer docs, MCP/API; case studies like Flatfile (single source of truth), Modal (workflow automation at scale), USV (siloed to unified).

## Additional Notes
Attio careers: Solutions Engineer (Pre and Post-Sales) SMB/Mid-Market. Target-companies doc: “RevOps / data-driven GTM” segment. Import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, CSV.
