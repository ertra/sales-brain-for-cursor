## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- **PLG or non-standard data model**: Need workspaces, deal flow objects, or custom entities; Pipedrive is contact/deal/pipeline; Attio built for "any business model"
- **Product + CRM in one place**: Want product usage and billing in CRM; Attio syncs Segment, warehouses; Pipedrive is sales-centric
- **AI that's grounded in your data**: Want meeting prep, deal brief, "real information not AI invention"; Ask Attio vs Pipedrive AI
- **Scaling and flexibility**: "From zero to IPO"; expect to change data model; Attio adapts without rip-and-replace
- **Single source of truth for GTM**: Workflows, reporting, and data model in one platform; Attio positions as "CRM behind thousands of companies" with full flexibility

### When They Win
- SMB that only needs simple pipeline and deal closing; "easy and effective" is the main requirement
- Team wants fastest possible adoption of a well-known sales CRM with 14-day trial
- No need for custom objects, workspaces, or product data in CRM

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Flexible data model**: Custom objects and relationships for workspaces, deal flow, PLG; "configure our CRM to fit our business needs" (Modal). Pipedrive is optimized for standard sales pipeline.
2. **Ask Attio and Universal Context**: Meeting prep, deal brief, daily brief from actual CRM data; permissions enforced; "real information, not AI invention." Different league from standard CRM AI.
3. **Single source of truth for product + customer**: Attio syncs product and billing data; one platform for GTM; Pipedrive stays sales-pipeline focused.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Easy and effective CRM" | True for simple pipeline | "When you need workspaces, product data, or a custom model, easy isn't enough—you need flexible. Attio is both." |
| "#1 user-rated" | Strong for SMB sales | "For PLG, deal flow, or scaling from zero to IPO, Attio is the CRM that adapts. We import from Pipedrive if you're ready." |
| "Tailored to your business" | Customizable pipeline/stages | "Attio is tailored to your data model—custom objects, workspaces, any structure. Not just pipeline stages." |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Pipedrive
"Pipedrive is great for straightforward pipeline management. If you need to model workspaces, product-led data, or deal flow (e.g. investors), or you want AI that's grounded in your CRM for meeting prep and deal briefs, Attio is built for that. We import from Pipedrive—happy to show you the difference."

### If Prospect is Evaluating Pipedrive
1. Ask: "Will you need to track workspaces, funds, or other custom entities—or is a standard contact/deal pipeline enough?"
2. Ask: "Where should product usage and billing data live—inside the CRM or in separate tools?"
3. Position: Attio for teams that expect to scale and adapt their data model; share "from zero to IPO" and Ask Attio.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "How would you model workspaces (or [their key entity]) in Pipedrive?"
2. "When you scale and your data model changes, how will Pipedrive keep up?"
3. "Do you want meeting prep and deal context from your actual CRM data, or generic AI?"
