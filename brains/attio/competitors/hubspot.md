# Competitor: HubSpot

## Overview
HubSpot offers a broad customer platform (Marketing, Sales, Service, Content, Data, Commerce Hubs) with a free CRM and paid hubs. Strong in inbound marketing, SMB, and all-in-one suite. Attio wins when prospects need a flexible data model (e.g. native workspaces for PLG), modern CRM that "fits the business rather than the other way around," and single source of truth for product + customer data without HubSpot's rigidity and cost.

- **Target Market**: SMB, marketing-led teams, inbound-focused; broad business suite

## Strengths
- Free CRM entry; strong brand and content

- Strong in inbound and marketing automation
- Large ecosystem, marketplace, and community

## Weaknesses
- **Inflexible data model for PLG**: No native support for workspaces or product-centric objects; "HubSpot does not have native support for that type of data. Trying to create a workaround was so confusing that we could never quite figure out how to set it up in an optimal way." — Margaret Shen, Modal (Head of Business Operations)
- **Object/relationship rigidity**: "The way it represents different objects and relationships felt really clunky"; "we quickly ended up with a CRM cluttered with all sorts of floating records, duplicate companies, and mismatches"
- **Cost at scale**: "Given the huge expense of HubSpot" (Modal); PLG teams outgrow it and hit limits
- **Not built for "configure to fit our business"**: Attio wins on flexible object model and native workspaces

## Feature Comparison

|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Native Workspaces / custom objects | ✅ Full flexibility | ❌ Workarounds | Modal: "native support was game-changing" (Attio) |
| Data model fit to PLG | ✅ Build your model | ⚠️ Rigid | Attio: "configure CRM to fit our business" |
| Object relationships | ✅ One-to-many, many-to-many | ⚠️ Clunky (per Modal) | Attio: "intuitively establish" relationships |
| Product data in CRM | ✅ Segment, reverse ETL, native | ⚠️ Via workarounds | Attio: single source for product + customer |
| Free tier | ✅ Attio Free | ✅ HubSpot Free | Both; Attio scales with flexible model |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- **PLG / product-led motion**: Need workspaces or product-centric data in CRM; HubSpot has no native support; Attio has native Workspaces and flexible model (Modal use case)
- **"Configure CRM to fit our business"**: Tired of floating records, duplicates, workarounds; want one-to-many and many-to-many without clutter (Modal)
- **Single source of truth for product + customer**: Want Segment/product data in CRM; Attio integrates natively; HubSpot workarounds confusing
- **Modern, flexible CRM**: "Next generation of CRM"; team wants a product that's "a delight to work in" (Modal quote re Attio)
- **Cost and fit**: HubSpot expensive and still doesn't fit; Attio Free to start, scale with Pro/Enterprise

### When They Win
- Heavily invested in HubSpot ecosystem (Marketing Hub, content, website) with no desire to change CRM
- Need broad marketing + sales + service suite from one vendor and don't need custom data model
- SMB that only needs simple contact/deal CRM and values HubSpot brand and free tier

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Native Workspaces and flexible data model**: Build for PLG, deal flow, or any model; "configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around" (Modal).
2. **Single source of truth for product + customer**: Segment and product data in CRM without confusing workarounds; "our whole product revolves around the notion of workspaces, so for there to be native support for this was game-changing."
3. **Modern UX and speed**: "Attio is so sleek and modern that it's ultimately just a delight to work in. I genuinely feel happy when I'm in the product, which is almost unheard of in the CRM space." — Margaret Shen, Modal.

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Easy-to-use CRM" | Easy for simple contact/deal; complex for PLG or custom objects | "For PLG, you need a CRM that natively supports workspaces and your data structure. Attio was built for that—Modal switched and never looked back." |
| "Streamline your entire business" | Broad suite; CRM can feel cluttered with workarounds (Modal) | "Attio streamlines GTM with one flexible CRM that actually represents your business. No workarounds, no floating records." |
| "Free CRM" | Free entry; scaling and hubs get expensive | "Attio Free gets you started; when you scale, you get a data model that scales with you—no rip-and-replace." |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions HubSpot
"HubSpot is great for marketing-led, simple pipelines. If you're PLG or need workspaces and product data in your CRM, their model wasn't built for it—Modal hit that wall. Attio gives you native Workspaces and a flexible data model so you configure the CRM to fit your business, not the other way around. We also import from HubSpot if you're ready to move."

### If Prospect is Evaluating HubSpot
1. Ask: "Do you need to track workspaces or product-centric entities in the CRM? How would you do that in HubSpot today?"
2. Ask: "Where does product usage data live, and how would it get into the CRM?"
3. Position: Attio as the CRM for teams that outgrow rigid models; share Modal story (PLG, workspaces, "next generation of CRM").

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "How would you model workspaces (or [their core entity]) in HubSpot—native or workaround?"
2. "Have you seen floating records, duplicate companies, or sync issues with your current setup?"
3. "When you need to change your data model as you scale, how long does that take with HubSpot?"

## Pricing Comparison
| | Attio | HubSpot |
|--|-------|---------|
| Model | Free, Plus, Pro, Enterprise (per user) | Free CRM; paid Hubs (Starter, Professional, Enterprise) |
| Entry Price | Free (€0) | Free CRM |
| Scale-up | Plus €29–36, Pro €69–86 (annual) | Sales Hub etc. add cost; can get expensive |
| Key Differences | Flexible data model, native Workspaces; from zero to IPO | Broad suite; rigid object model for PLG; Attio imports from HubSpot |
