# Competitor: Salesforce (Sales Cloud)

## Overview
Salesforce Sales Cloud is the dominant enterprise CRM. Rigid structure, powerful but complex configuration, and sync/integration challenges at scale. Attio wins when prospects need a flexible data model that matches their business, consistent data capture without "sync chaos," and faster time to value without "death by a thousand cuts." Flatfile migrated from Salesforce to Attio in ~1 month.

## Company Information
- **Website**: https://www.salesforce.com/
- **Founded**: 1999
- **Headquarters**: San Francisco, CA, USA
- **Company Size**: Very large (50,000+); enterprise standard
- **Funding/Revenue**: Public (CRM); enterprise pricing, high TCO
- **Key Customers**: Enterprise; Fortune 500; broad industry

## Product Overview
Sales Cloud: leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, pipeline, forecasting, reporting. Ecosystem: AppExchange, MuleSoft, Tableau, Slack, etc. Highly configurable but schema and sync are often brittle. Attio imports from Salesforce (migration path).

### Key Products
| Product | Description | Competes With |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Sales Cloud | CRM, pipeline, forecasting, reporting | Attio Platform, Reporting |
| Custom objects | Possible but complex, not as flexible | Attio Data model (native flexibility) |
| Integrations / sync | MuleSoft, connectors; often break | Attio "connect to everything downstream, it all just works" (Flatfile) |

## Positioning & Messaging
- **Tagline**: "The world's #1 CRM"; Customer 360
- **Key Message**: Enterprise scale, ecosystem, market leader
- **Target Market**: Enterprise; companies that standardize on Salesforce

## Strengths
- Market leader; enterprise trust and compliance
- Huge ecosystem (AppExchange, consultants, talent)
- Deep features for large sales orgs (forecasting, territory, etc.)
- Standard for many procurement and RFPs

## Weaknesses
- **Rigid structure and sync chaos**: "There was always this sync needed between Salesforce and everything else. It created chaos. Records would exist in one format in Salesforce and overwrite something else, or legacy settings would just break the sync completely." — Jason Wolf, Director of Data Engineering, Flatfile
- **Duplicate records and data loss**: "Duplicate records piled up"; "high profile opportunities were slipping through the cracks - big companies, big names, and big founders that we wanted to be talking to were ending up lost"
- **Simple changes are hard**: "Even making simple changes was a challenge"; "Growth limited by Salesforce"; "It was like death by a thousand cuts"
- **Expensive and complex**: Implementation and ongoing config; Attio offers "powerful, intuitive, and incredibly flexible" with faster migration (e.g. full move in ~1 month per Flatfile)

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Attio | Salesforce | Notes |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| Flexible data model | ✅ Custom objects, relationships | ⚠️ Configurable but rigid | Flatfile: "data model super powerful, relationships really flexible" (Attio) |
| Sync / integrations | ✅ "Connect to everything downstream, it all just works" | ⚠️ Sync breaks, overwrites (Flatfile) | Attio: single source of truth without chaos |
| Implementation speed | ✅ e.g. full migration ~1 month | ⚠️ Often months | Flatfile moved entire CRM to Attio in ~1 month |
| Duplicate / data loss | ✅ Clean model, one source | ❌ "Duplicate records piled up"; opportunities lost | Attio: consistent capture, no high-profile slips |
| From first touch to close | ✅ Workflows, one model | ⚠️ Possible but complex | Attio: "complete automation of customer lifecycle" |
| Import from | — | — | Attio imports from Salesforce (migration) |

## Competitive Battlecard

### When We Win
- **Sync and data chaos**: "Sync between Salesforce and everything else created chaos"; records overwrite, legacy settings break; want "it all just works" (Flatfile)
- **Lost opportunities**: High-profile deals and relationships slipping; duplicate records; need consistent data capture and single source of truth
- **Growth limited by CRM**: "Death by a thousand cuts"; need a CRM that matches exact business model and processes (Flatfile)
- **Faster, flexible implementation**: Willing to migrate for flexible data model and relationship attributes; Attio full move in ~1 month (Flatfile)
- **Scale-ups and mid-market**: Don't need Salesforce ecosystem; want modern, flexible CRM and reporting

### When They Win
- Enterprise mandated Salesforce; procurement or IT standard
- Heavy investment in Salesforce ecosystem (AppExchange, MuleSoft, Tableau, Slack) with no migration appetite
- Need Salesforce-specific features (e.g. complex territory, industry clouds) and have resources to maintain it

### Key Differentiators (Our Advantages)
1. **Flexible data model, no sync chaos**: "The data model is super powerful, and the relationships between objects are really flexible. We can connect to everything downstream, and it all just works." — Jason Wolf, Flatfile
2. **No more lost opportunities**: "High profile opportunities slipping through the cracks" → Attio delivers consistent capture, automation from first touch to closed deal, single source of truth
3. **Fast migration and "everything you want, and more"**: "Within a month, Flatfile had moved their entire CRM to Attio." "Attio is powerful, intuitive, and incredibly flexible. It's going to do everything you think you want, and then surprise you with what else is possible."

### Their Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "#1 CRM" | Leader in market share; not in flexibility or "it just works" for many scale-ups | "Flatfile was growth-limited by Salesforce. They moved to Attio in a month and got a single source of truth with no sync chaos." |
| "Customizable" | Configurable but rigid; sync and legacy settings cause breaks (Flatfile) | "Attio's data model is flexible by design. Connect everything downstream and it all just works—no overwrites, no broken sync." |
| "Complete view of customer" | Possible but duplicates and data loss common (Flatfile) | "We give you one source of truth. Complete automation from first touch to closed deal; no high-profile names slipping through." |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Salesforce
"Salesforce is the standard for a reason, but a lot of scaling teams hit sync chaos, duplicate records, and lost opportunities—Flatfile did. They moved to Attio in about a month and got a flexible data model and single source of truth. We import from Salesforce, so migration is straightforward. Want to see how they did it?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Salesforce
1. Ask: "How will you keep Salesforce in sync with your other systems—and what happens when the sync breaks or overwrites records?"
2. Ask: "Have you heard of teams losing track of high-value opportunities or drowning in duplicate records?"
3. Position: Attio for teams that want "it all just works," flexible relationships, and fast time to value; share Flatfile story.

### Trap-Setting Questions
1. "What's your plan to avoid sync breaks and record overwrites between Salesforce and the rest of your stack?"
2. "How long do you expect implementation and go-live to take—and have you budgeted for ongoing config when the business model changes?"
3. "Where will you get a single source of truth for first touch to closed deal without duplicate records?"

## Pricing Comparison
| | Attio | Salesforce |
|--|-------|------------|
| Model | Free, Plus, Pro, Enterprise (per user) | Per-seat; Sales Cloud tiers; often add-ons |
| Entry Price | Free (€0) | Higher entry; enterprise-oriented |
| Scale-up | Plus €29–36, Pro €69–86 (annual) | Significant at scale |
| Key Differences | Flexible model, "it all just works"; import from Salesforce | Ecosystem; rigidity and sync issues (per Flatfile) |
