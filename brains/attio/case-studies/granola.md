# Case Study: Granola

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Granola |
| **Industry** | SaaS (AI notepad for back-to-back meetings) |
| **Company Size** | 25–50 employees; $63M Series B; London, UK; founded 2023 |
| **Products Used** | Attio (Workflows, Custom objects, Integrations: Zapier, Polytomic, Clay) |
| **Primary Persona** | GTM team / Revenue Operations |
| **Use Case** | Turn product signals into revenue; 83% faster lead triage; single source of truth for leads + product data |

## Executive Summary
Granola's inbox was inundated with inbound leads with no systematic way to prioritize. Product usage lived in BI tools, high-potential prospects sat in the inbox, and manual triage consumed hours with no path to scale. With Attio they built an intelligent platform: capture every lead via Tally → Zapier into a custom Inbound Leads object, tier 1–3 with workflows into Deals, and connect product usage (Polytomic) and enrichment (Clay) to every record. Result: 83% faster lead triage, 10x faster access to customer context, 5 hours per week saved on deal updates, lead review down from 2 hours to 20 minutes daily, and 100% GTM team adoption.

## The Customer

- **Industry**: SaaS — AI notepad for people in back-to-back meetings
- **Size**: 25–50; scaled to 40+ in under a year; $63M Series B
- **Location**: London, UK
- **Business Model**: B2B; product-led / inbound-heavy

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Fast-growing, inbound-driven startup. Inbox inundated with inbound leads weekly; no systematic way to prioritize. High-potential prospects sat in the inbox; product usage data lived in BI tools; manual triage consumed hours with no path to scale.

### Key Pain Points
- No single place to see all deals and new interested companies
- Product usage not connected to customer records—sales couldn't see engagement at a glance
- Manual triage; lead review took 2 hours daily
- No automated path from lead → tier → pipeline for AEs

### Business Impact
- High-potential leads went cold; missed opportunities
- AEs lacked context when they did get to leads
- Could not scale GTM team without a scalable process
- "When I think of revenue, I think of Attio" — became indispensable as they scale

### What They Tried Before
- Manual review and triage; product data in separate BI tools
- Needed a system that could capture every lead automatically, connect product usage to customer records, and surface highest-value opportunities without manual work

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Attio
- **One place for deals and new companies**: "The moment we started setting Attio up, everything became clear. For the first time, we could actually see all of our deals in one place."
- **Product + lead data in CRM**: Polytomic for product usage, Clay for enrichment; "Connecting our whole stack was a real lightbulb moment. Suddenly, we could see the right people, the right context, at the right time. That's when Attio felt magical."
- **Workflows that scale**: Custom Inbound Leads object; Zapier from Tally; tier 1–3; workflows promote high-value leads into Deals so "the workflow automatically qualifying and surfacing leads is a huge unlock for our sales team. It saves so much time."
- **Ready to triple GTM team**: With total adoption, automated lead workflows, and product usage on every deal, they can scale without losing visibility.

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Workflows | Inbound lead capture → tiering → promote to Deals; automated deal updates |
| Custom objects | Inbound Leads object; Deals |
| Integrations | Zapier (Tally → Attio), Polytomic (product usage), Clay (enrichment) |
| Data model | Company/person + product usage + enrichment on every record |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Decision**: Following rapid growth; needed infrastructure to match velocity
- **Implementation**: Built "complete GTM platform" — inbound leads automatic, product signals synced, workflows routing prospects to AEs
- **Time to Value**: "Now, we have this one place where we can see existing deals and new companies that are interested in chatting to us. It felt like when you can see for the first time."
