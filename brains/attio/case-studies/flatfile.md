## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Flatfile |

| **Company Size** | 51–100 employees; $94.8m Series B; Denver, CO; founded 2018 |
| **Products Used** | Attio (Data model, Workflows, Relationship attributes, Reports) |
| **Primary Persona** | Revenue Operations / Director of Data Engineering |
| **Use Case** | Single source of truth for all GTM; automate lifecycle first touch to close; powerful reporting; migrate from Salesforce |

## Executive Summary
Flatfile hit growth limits with Salesforce: sync chaos between Salesforce and other systems, duplicate records, and high-profile opportunities slipping through. "It was like death by a thousand cuts." They moved their entire CRM to Attio in about a month. With Attio's flexible data model, relationship attributes, and workflows they automated the customer lifecycle from first touch to closed deal, built powerful historical reporting across sales, success, and finance, and achieved a single source of truth for all go-to-market processes. "The data model is super powerful, and the relationships between objects are really flexible. We can connect to everything downstream, and it all just works."

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Data Migration — AI-powered data exchange; automate importing and cleaning data
- **Size**: 51–100; ~$95M funding (Series B); rapid growth; G2 awards
- **Location**: Denver, Colorado
- **Business Model**: B2B; "universal tool that could make even the most complex data migration simple"

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Scaled through Airtable → Freshsales → Salesforce. "There was always this sync needed between Salesforce and everything else. It created chaos. Records would exist in one format in Salesforce and overwrite something else, or legacy settings would just break the sync completely." Managing customer data became a daily struggle: duplicate records piled up; even simple changes were a challenge. "Salesforce's limitations were stunting Flatfile's growth."

### Key Pain Points
- **Sync chaos**: Salesforce and other systems; records in one format overwriting another; legacy settings breaking sync
- **Duplicate records**: Piled up; no single source of truth
- **Lost opportunities**: "High profile opportunities were slipping through the cracks—big companies, big names, and big founders that we wanted to be talking to were ending up lost"
- **Simple changes hard**: "Even making simple changes was a challenge"
- **Growth limited**: "It was like death by a thousand cuts"

### Business Impact
- Critical data loss between systems
- Missing key opportunities; losing track of valuable customer relationships
- Stunted growth; daily struggle to manage customer data
- Need for consistent data capture, opportunity tracking, and rapid GTM growth

### What They Tried Before
- Airtable, then Freshsales, then Salesforce
- "There was always this sync needed… it created chaos"
- Led to search for "a better solution"; CEO discovered Attio

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Attio
- **Data model and flexibility**: "I'm always skeptical when people throw me random tools, but Attio was different; it didn't take me long to see that there was something real here. The data model is super powerful, and the relationships between objects are really flexible. We can connect to everything downstream, and it all just works." — Jason Wolf, Director of Data Engineering
- **CEO conviction**: "Could this just be our entire stack?" — David Boskovic, CEO (to Jason)
- **What Salesforce couldn't deliver**: Attio's powerful data model, automation engine, auto data enrichment, and custom objects gave Flatfile exactly that
- **Speed of migration**: Within a month, Flatfile had moved their entire CRM to Attio
- **Surprise and possibility**: "Attio is powerful, intuitive, and incredibly flexible. It's going to do everything you think you want, and then surprise you with what else is possible."

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Data model (relationship attributes) | Flexible objects and relationships; connect to everything downstream |
| Workflows | Automate funnel from first touch to close; activity (form, email) creates/updates Deal; subsequent activity attaches to Deal |
| Deals + People objects | Complete overview of historical emails and interactions; "individual user's journey is so much easier to understand when you can view it in the context of the rest of their company" |
| Reports | Powerful historical reporting across sales, success, finance; enterprise-grade self-serve |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Decision**: After "growth limited by Salesforce"; CEO discovered Attio; Jason convinced quickly
- **Implementation**: Full CRM migration to Attio in about one month
- **Time to Value**: "It didn't take me long to see that there was something real here"; "it all just works"
