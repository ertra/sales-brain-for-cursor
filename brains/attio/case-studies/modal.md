# Case Study: Modal

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer** | Modal |
| **Industry** | Artificial Intelligence (serverless platform for AI/ML workloads) |
| **Company Size** | 11–50 employees; $23m Series A; New York City; founded 2021 |
| **Products Used** | Attio (Workspaces object, Integrations, Workflows); Segment for product data |
| **Primary Persona** | Revenue Operations / Head of Business Operations |
| **Use Case** | Workflow automation at scale for PLG; single source of truth for customer and product data; CRM that fits business |

## Executive Summary
Modal struggled to align product-led growth with HubSpot's inflexible data model. No native support for workspaces; workarounds led to floating records, duplicate companies, and mismatches. They switched to Attio for a modern CRM with native Workspaces, Segment integration for product data, and high-impact workflows. Result: "It finally felt like I could configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around." Attio became the center of their GTM stack—single source of truth for customer and product data, automations that accelerate PLG, and a product that's "a delight to work in."

## The Customer

- **Industry**: Artificial Intelligence — serverless platform for developers (compute-intensive tasks, AI/ML)
- **Size**: 11–50; $23m Series A (e.g. $16m); thousands of users (Ramp, Substack, Suno)
- **Location**: New York City, NY
- **Business Model**: B2B; PLG; "we work especially closely with teams building AI products or features"

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
Used HubSpot to unify product and customer data. "It was really difficult to set up HubSpot to reflect our data structure. The way it represents different objects and relationships felt really clunky, and we quickly ended up with a CRM cluttered with all sorts of floating records, duplicate companies, and mismatches between records."

### Key Pain Points
- **No native workspaces**: "As a PLG business, the notion of workspaces is really key for us to track product data. HubSpot does not have native support for that type of data. Trying to create a workaround was so confusing that we could never quite figure out how to set it up in an optimal way."
- **Rigid objects and relationships**: Clunky representation; floating records, duplicates, mismatches
- **Cost and fit**: "Given the huge expense of HubSpot and the hassle of trying to force PLG motion to fit its data structures, Modal knew they needed to find a CRM that could truly represent their business."

### Business Impact
- Could not build a CRM that actually represented their business
- No single source of truth for product and customer data
- High cost for a solution that didn't fit
- Needed a CRM that could represent their business to drive PLG

### What They Tried Before
- HubSpot with workarounds for workspaces and PLG data
- Result: confusion, suboptimal setup, floating records, duplicates

## The Solution

### Why They Chose Attio
- **"Next generation of CRM"**: "When I first opened Attio, I instantly got the feeling that this was the start of the next generation of CRM." — Margaret Shen, Head of Business Operations
- **Powerful, flexible data model**: "For there to be such a powerful and flexible object relational system was incredible. It finally felt like I could configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around."
- **Native Workspaces**: "Our whole product revolves around the notion of workspaces, so for there to be native support for this was game-changing. Being able to intuitively establish one-to-many and many-to-many relationships is crucial to making our data clean and understandable."
- **Product design**: "Attio is so sleek and modern that it's ultimately just a delight to work in. I genuinely feel happy when I'm in the product, which is almost unheard of in the CRM space."
- **Single source of truth + workflows**: "Attio gives us confidence that we have a strong foundation of customer data that we can trust, which enables us to build very high leverage, high impact workflows and automations to drive our GTM motion."

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
