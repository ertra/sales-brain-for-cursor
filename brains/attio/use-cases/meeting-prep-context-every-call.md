# Use Case: Full Context Before Every Call (Meeting Prep)

## Overview
Sales and CS reps waste time hunting for context before calls—scattered across email, calendar, notes, and Slack. They risk showing up underprepared or missing key info. Use Ask Attio to centralize meeting prep, deal briefs, and daily briefs from actual CRM data (Universal Context), with permissions enforced. Win faster when every call is perfectly prepped; update deals in seconds with suggestions you approve or modify.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Any B2B; strong fit for sales-led and hybrid GTM
- **Size**: Small team to enterprise; any team where reps run many meetings
- **Characteristics**: Reps need fast, accurate context; CRM must stay up to date; care about "real information, not AI invention"

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Sales Rep (AE, SDR), Customer Success Manager
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales/CS leadership, RevOps (permissions and data)

### Trigger Event
- Lost deal or bad call that could have been avoided with better prep; leadership complaining about pipeline accuracy; scaling team and need consistent prep and updates.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Context in email, calendar, notes, Slack—copy-paste and tab-switching to prep
- Risk of missing key info or showing up underprepared
- Deal and activity updates manual; pipeline goes stale
- AI tools that aren't grounded in CRM or don't respect permissions

### Desired State (After)
- One place for everything needed before every meeting—real data from CRM and connected tools
- Prep in minutes; "centralize, summarize, and surface everything I need to know"
- Update deal/next step in seconds (approve suggestion or natural language)
- Permissions enforced; human in the loop (approve, modify, reject)

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Ask Attio (meeting prep, deal brief, daily brief, recap call, update deal)
- **Supporting**: Data model (activity timelines, enrichment), Workflows (optional auto-updates)

### Solution Overview
Use Ask Attio for meeting prep, deal brief, and daily brief—powered by Universal Context (emails, calls, notes, product usage, connected tools). Every answer sourced from actual CRM records; permissions enforced so reps see only what they're allowed to. Use suggestions to update deal stage, next step, or role; approve, modify, or reject. Optional: recap call → update deal from recording; suggest next steps. Multilingual; semantic search at scale.

### Implementation Steps
1. Connect email, calendar, and key tools (Slack, etc.) so Universal Context is complete
2. Train reps on Ask Attio: "Prep for next meeting," "Deal brief," "Daily brief"; use suggestions for updates
3. Configure permissions so Ask Attio respects existing access
4. Optional: enable recap call, update deal from call, suggest next steps for maximum pipeline freshness
