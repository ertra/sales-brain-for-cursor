# Use Case: Deal Flow at Scale for Investors

## Overview
Investors and deal-flow teams track deals and companies in spreadsheets or CRMs built for sales. They need a data model that fits investing (funds, deals, companies, relationships), one source of truth for the whole team, and pipeline reporting that scales. Use Attio to build the "perfect deal engine"—custom objects, unified data, real-time reporting—so nothing slips and partners stay aligned.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Venture capital, PE, investment firms
- **Size**: Small (single fund) to large (many partners and associates)
- **Characteristics**: Track deals, companies, funds, relationships; need flexible objects and pipeline by stage; often siloed data across partners

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Investor / Deal flow (Partner, Associate, Ops)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Partners, associates, LP/board (reporting)

### Trigger Event
- Deal flow growing; spreadsheets or current tool breaking; need consistent process; LP or board asking for pipeline and portfolio reporting.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Deals and companies in spreadsheets or sales CRM (wrong-shaped objects)
- No native concept of Fund, Deal (investment amount, stage), or right company/contact associations
- Data siloed across partners and tools; no unified pipeline view
- Reporting doesn't scale—manual exports or limited visibility

### Desired State (After)
- Data model that fits investing: Fund, Deal, Company, Person with right attributes
- One source of truth for the whole team; "perfect deal engine"
- Pipeline and portfolio reporting in real time; group by stage, source, partner, fund
- Scale deal flow without losing control or visibility

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Data model (custom objects: Fund, Deal, Company, Person), Reporting
- **Supporting**: Workflows (optional automation), Integrations

### Solution Overview
Model funds, deals, companies, and people in Attio with custom objects and attributes (e.g. investment amount, deal stage). One workspace for all partners and associates; activity and enrichment on every record. Use Reporting for pipeline and portfolio—real-time, group your way, drill down, dashboards. Optional workflows for deal updates and notifications. "Attio for Deal flow."
