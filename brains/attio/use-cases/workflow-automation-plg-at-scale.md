# Use Case: Workflow Automation at Scale for Product-Led Growth

## Overview
PLG teams are hindered by CRMs that don't support their data model (e.g. workspaces, product usage). HubSpot and others force workarounds—floating records, duplicate companies, no native workspace support—and scaling workflows is painful. Use Attio as the central foundation for product and customer data: native Workspaces object, Segment integration, and high-impact workflows that accelerate PLG without fighting the tool.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: Artificial Intelligence, SaaS, developer tools; PLG motion
- **Size**: 11–50 employees; e.g. $23m Series A, thousands of users
- **Characteristics**: Product revolves around workspaces; need CRM that represents their data structure; want single source of truth for customer and product data

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Operations, Head of Business Operations
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales, Customer Success, GTM leadership

### Trigger Event
- PLG motion outgrowing current CRM (e.g. HubSpot); inflexible data model; duplicate records and sync chaos; need to build workflows on a foundation that fits.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- CRM doesn't reflect business (e.g. no native workspaces); "floating records, duplicate companies, mismatches"
- Workarounds confusing and suboptimal; huge expense for limited flexibility
- Product and customer data not unified; can't build high-leverage workflows
- "It was really difficult to set up HubSpot to reflect our data structure… we quickly ended up with a CRM cluttered with all sorts of floating records"

### Desired State (After)
- CRM that fits the business—native support for workspaces, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
- Single source of truth for customer and product data; Segment (or similar) keeping CRM up to date
- High-impact workflows and automations that drive PLG; center of GTM stack
- Team actually wants to use the product; "delight to work in"

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Data model (Workspaces object, custom objects), Workflows, Integrations (Segment)
- **Supporting**: Reporting, Ask Attio

### Solution Overview
Use Attio's native Workspaces object and flexible relationships to model product and customer data. Sync product data via Segment (workspace info, usage) and associate with companies and people. Build workflows on this foundation—routing, notifications, lifecycle—so GTM runs on one trusted dataset. Attio becomes the center of the GTM stack.

### Implementation Steps
1. Migrate or set up Attio with Workspaces object and company/person; define relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
2. Connect Segment (or reverse ETL) to sync workspace and product usage into Attio; map to companies and people
3. Build workflows for PLG (e.g. PQL routing, onboarding, expansion triggers) on top of unified data
4. Train team; adopt Attio as single source of truth and center of stack

## Value Delivered

### Quantified Benefits
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Data model fit | Native workspaces; no workarounds |
| Foundation for workflows | High-leverage automations on trusted data |
| Team satisfaction | "Delight to work in"; "genuinely feel happy" in product |

## Proof Points

### Customer Example
- **Company**: Modal (serverless platform for AI/ML workloads); AI, 11–50, NYC; $23m Series A; users include Ramp, Substack, Suno
- **Challenge**: HubSpot inflexible; couldn't represent workspaces; floating records, duplicates, mismatches; PLG hindered
- **Solution**: Attio with native Workspaces object; Segment for workspace and product data; workflows on top of single source of truth; center of GTM stack
- **Results**: Automations engine that accelerates PLG; CRM that reflects their data; efficient, collaborative, scales
- **Quote**: "When I first opened Attio, I instantly got the feeling that this was the start of the next generation of CRM." — Margaret Shen, Head of Business Operations

- **Quote**: "Attio is so sleek and modern that it's ultimately just a delight to work in. I genuinely feel happy when I'm in the product, which is almost unheard of in the CRM space."

### Data Points
- Native Workspaces object; Segment integration for product data
- Single source of truth for customer and product data; high-impact workflows

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. How does your current CRM represent workspaces (or your core product entity)—native or workaround?
2. Where does product usage data live, and how does it get into the CRM today?
3. What workflows would you build if you had a CRM that actually reflected your business?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Workspaces object and relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Segment (or similar) syncing product data into Attio
- Workflows built on unified data (e.g. PQL routing, lifecycle)
- One view: company + people + workspaces + usage

### Key Talking Points
- "Configure your CRM to fit your business, not the other way around"
- "Native Workspaces—no workarounds"
- "Single source of truth for customer and product data; build high-impact workflows on top"
