# Use Case: Turn Product Signals Into Revenue — Faster Lead Triage

## Overview
PLG and inbound-heavy teams are drowning in leads but have no systematic way to prioritize. Product usage lives in BI tools, high-potential prospects sit in the inbox, and manual triage doesn't scale. Use Attio to capture every lead, tier them with workflows, connect product signals to customer records, and route the highest-value opportunities to AEs—achieving 83% faster lead triage and 10x faster access to context.

## Context

### Target Company Profile
- **Industry**: SaaS, AI, tech; product-led or strong inbound motion
- **Size**: 25–50+ employees; scaling GTM; e.g. $63M Series B, 40+ people in under a year
- **Characteristics**: Inbound-driven; need to turn usage signals into revenue without slowing down; modern tech stack

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Revenue Operations, Sales Leader
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Account Executives (daily users), Marketing (lead source)

### Trigger Event
- Inbound volume growing; manual triage consuming hours; product usage data not connected to CRM; high-potential leads going cold in inbox.

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Inbox inundated with inbound leads; no systematic prioritization
- Product usage data in BI tools, not in CRM; sales can't see engagement at a glance
- Manual triage consumes hours with no path to scale
- High-potential prospects sit in inbox; AEs lack context when they do get to them

### Desired State (After)
- Every lead captured automatically; tiered (e.g. 1–3) and routed to pipeline
- Product signals (active users, engagement, usage patterns) on every company/person record
- Lead review time cut dramatically (e.g. 2 hours → 20 minutes daily)
- Zero missed leads; 10x faster access to customer context; full GTM team adoption

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Workflows, Custom objects (e.g. Inbound Leads), Integrations (Zapier, Polytomic, Clay)
- **Supporting**: Data model (company/person + product sync), Reporting

### Solution Overview
Capture every lead via form (e.g. Tally) → Zapier into Attio into a custom "Inbound Leads" object. GTM reviews daily, tiers 1–3; workflows promote high-value leads into Deals pipeline. Sync product usage (e.g. Polytomic app) and enrichment (e.g. Clay) so every record shows active users, engagement, usage patterns. One place for deals and new companies; AEs see the right context at the right time.

### Implementation Steps
1. Create custom Inbound Leads object; connect form (e.g. Tally) via Zapier so every response lands in Attio
2. Build workflow: new lead → tiering view; tier 1–3 → promote to Deals object for AEs
3. Connect product data (Polytomic or similar) and enrichment (Clay); associate with companies and people
4. Train team on daily review and tiering; adopt "Deals object + workflow" as single source for qualified pipeline

## Value Delivered
