# Sales Play: Meeting Prep & Context — Ask Attio for Sales Teams

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Meeting Prep & Context — Ask Attio for Sales Teams |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Rep (AE, SDR), Sales Leader |
| **Target Company** | B2B sales teams; many meetings; context scattered across tools; want faster prep and accurate pipeline |
| **Products** | Ask Attio, Data model (activity, enrichment), Workflows (optional) |
| **Trigger Event** | Prep takes too long; pipeline stale; "we need better context before calls"; lost deal that could have been avoided |
| **Play Type** | Value / Productivity |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Reps or leaders say prep is manual and time-consuming
- Pipeline accuracy or data entry complaints
- Lost deal or bad call that could have been avoided with better context
- Evaluating "AI for sales" or "CRM that helps with meeting prep"

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Sales team running 10+ meetings per week per rep
- Using multiple tools for context (email, calendar, Slack, notes)
- Interest in AI but concerned about "hallucination" or control
- Granola-style: inbound/PLG + need to triage and prep fast

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | Small team to mid-market (5–50+ sellers) |
| Industry | B2B; any vertical with heavy meeting load |
| Pain | Prep time, scattered context, manual deal updates, or pipeline accuracy |
| Attitude | Open to "one place for prep" and AI grounded in their data |

## The Play

### Objective
Win sales teams by positioning Ask Attio: meeting prep, deal brief, and daily brief from actual CRM data (real information, not AI invention); permissions enforced; update deals in seconds (approve suggestion or natural language). Win faster when every call is perfectly prepped.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Before every meeting, Ask Attio centralizes and surfaces everything you need to know—from your CRM and connected tools. Real information, not AI invention; your permissions, enforced. You update deals in seconds. Granola's team saves 5 hours per week on deal updates and cut lead review from 2 hours to 20 minutes. Ian Ahuja (Head of Sales): 'Before every meeting, Ask Attio centralizes, summarizes, and surfaces everything I need to know to give a great first impression or close the deal.'"

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 10 minutes

- [ ] Confirm sales team size and meeting load; where they get context today (email, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] Note if they have product/usage data (Ask Attio can include it)
- [ ] Prepare Ian Ahuja and Granola one-liners; [sales-rep-value-prop.md](../value-propositions/sales-rep-value-prop.md)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How much time do you spend prepping for each call, and where do you pull context from?
2. When you get off a call, how do you update the deal and next steps—and how often does it slip?
3. Would 'real information from your CRM, with you approving every suggestion' address any concern about AI?

**Key Points**: One place for prep; real information, not AI invention; permissions; approve/modify/reject; 5 hrs/week saved (Granola); 2h→20min review.

### Step 3: Demo
**Demo Flow**: Ask Attio — "Prep for next meeting," "Deal brief," "Daily brief" → show source (emails, notes, etc.); show suggestion (e.g. update deal stage) → approve/modify/reject; optional: recap call, update deal from call.

### Step 4: Close
**Proposal**: Attio Pro (Ask Attio full capability); 14-day free trial; Granola and Ian Ahuja as proof.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We don't trust AI with our deals" | "Ask Attio is grounded in your actual CRM—real information, not AI invention. Your permissions are enforced, and you approve, modify, or reject every suggestion. You stay in control." |
| "Another tool to learn" | "Attio is the CRM—you're not adding a tool, you're getting one place for pipeline and prep. Granola has 100% team adoption; Modal said it's a delight to work in." |
| "Our process works" | "Same process—just faster. Prep in minutes, update in seconds. Granola saved 5 hours per week and cut lead review from 2 hours to 20 minutes." |
