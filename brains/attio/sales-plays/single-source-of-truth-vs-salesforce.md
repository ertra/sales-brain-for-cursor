# Sales Play: Single Source of Truth — Migrate from Salesforce

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Single Source of Truth — Migrate from Salesforce |
| **Target Persona** | Revenue Operations, Director of Data/Engineering, GTM Leader |
| **Target Company** | 51–100+; using Salesforce; sync chaos, duplicates, or lost opportunities |
| **Products** | Attio (Data model, Workflows, Relationship attributes, Reports) |
| **Trigger Event** | Salesforce renewal; "sync chaos"; high-profile opportunities slipping; growth limited by CRM |
| **Play Type** | Competitive / Displacement |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Salesforce contract renewal (3–6 months out)
- Prospect mentions sync issues, duplicate records, or lost deals
- New RevOps or data lead with mandate to fix "single source of truth"
- "Growth limited by Salesforce" or "death by a thousand cuts" type language

### Ideal Customer Signals
- Scaling fast; complex customer/deal relationships
- Using Salesforce + other systems; sync between them is painful
- Lost high-value opportunities or relationships due to data issues
- Job post or content: "single source of truth," "data quality," "automate lifecycle"

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | 51–100+ (or scaling 25+) |
| Industry | B2B; data-heavy GTM; any vertical |
| Tech Stack | Salesforce; often Airtable/Freshsales in history; multiple touchpoints |
| Pain | Sync chaos, duplicates, lost opportunities, or "can't get one view" |

## The Play

### Objective
Win teams limited by Salesforce by positioning Attio's flexible data model and "it all just works" with downstream systems. Single source of truth; complete automation from first touch to closed deal; powerful reporting. Full migration in ~1 month (Flatfile proof).

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Flatfile was growth-limited by Salesforce—sync chaos, duplicate records, high-profile opportunities lost. They moved to Attio in about a month and got a single source of truth, complete automation of the customer lifecycle, and powerful historical reporting. The data model is super powerful; we connect to everything downstream and it all just works."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

- [ ] Confirm Salesforce in use; note renewal timing if visible
- [ ] Look for signals: data team, RevOps, "single source of truth," sync or integration pain
- [ ] Prepare Flatfile one-liner and case study link; competitor doc [Salesforce](../competitors/salesforce.md)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How do you keep Salesforce in sync with your other systems—and what happens when the sync breaks or overwrites records?
2. Have you lost track of high-value opportunities or relationships because of data issues?
3. Can you get a complete historical view of a customer—emails, interactions, deals—in one place today?

**Key Points**: "It all just works"; flexible data model; Flatfile in ~1 month; single source of truth; no more lost opportunities.

### Step 3: Demo
**Demo Flow**: Data model (flexible objects, relationship attributes) → Workflow: first touch (form/email) creates/updates Deal; all activity attaches to Deal → People + Deals = full history → Reporting (historical, by team). Contrast with "sync and duplicates in Salesforce."

### Step 4: Close
**Proposal**: Attio Pro or Enterprise; migration from Salesforce (we import); phased plan; Flatfile story and reference if needed.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We've customized Salesforce so much" | "Flatfile had complex relationships too. Attio's data model is flexible by design—you gain consistency and 'connect to everything downstream, it all just works.' We import from Salesforce." |
| "Migration would be too painful" | "Flatfile moved their entire CRM in about a month. We have structured import and help docs; can run a pilot in parallel." |
| "We need enterprise security" | "Attio is GDPR, CCPA, ISO; Enterprise has SSO and advanced admin. We're built for scale and compliance." |
