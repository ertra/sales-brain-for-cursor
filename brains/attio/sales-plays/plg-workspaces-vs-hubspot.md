# Sales Play: PLG / Workspaces — Win vs HubSpot

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | PLG / Workspaces — Win vs HubSpot |
| **Target Persona** | Revenue Operations, Head of Business Operations, Founder/GTM Leader |
| **Target Company** | PLG or product-led sales; 11–50+; using HubSpot; need workspaces or product data in CRM |
| **Products** | Attio (Data model, Workspaces object, Workflows, Integrations e.g. Segment) |
| **Trigger Event** | HubSpot can't model workspaces; floating records, duplicates; PLG motion hindered |
| **Play Type** | Competitive / Displacement |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Prospect mentions HubSpot and "workspaces" or "product data in CRM"
- Job post or LinkedIn: RevOps, Business Ops at PLG company; "single source of truth for product and customer"
- Prospect says CRM doesn't reflect their business or they have workarounds

### Ideal Customer Signals
- PLG or product-led sales motion; track workspaces, usage, or product-centric entities
- Using HubSpot; may mention cost or "cluttered" CRM
- Segment or product analytics in stack; want it in CRM

### Qualification Criteria
| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Company Size | 11–50+ (scale-up PLG) |
| Industry | SaaS, AI, developer tools; product-led |
| Tech Stack | HubSpot (or evaluating); often Segment, product DB |
| Pain | Need workspaces/product in CRM; floating records, duplicates, or workarounds |

## The Play

### Objective
Win PLG teams currently on HubSpot by positioning Attio's native Workspaces and flexible data model. "Configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around." Single source of truth for customer and product data; high-impact workflows on top.

### Value Proposition (for this play)
"Modal left HubSpot because they needed workspaces and product data in the CRM—HubSpot had no native support and they had floating records and duplicates. With Attio they got native Workspaces, Segment syncing product data, and a CRM that's a delight to work in. One source of truth; build high-impact workflows that actually drive PLG."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research & Preparation
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

- [ ] Confirm HubSpot in use; any mention of workspaces, product data, or PLG in their content
- [ ] Check for Segment or product analytics (LinkedIn, site, job posts)
- [ ] Prepare Modal one-liner and case study link; competitor doc [HubSpot](../competitors/hubspot.md)

### Step 2: Discovery
**Discovery Questions**:
1. How do you track workspaces (or your core product entity) in HubSpot today—native or workaround?
2. Where does product usage data live, and how does it get into the CRM?
3. Have you run into floating records, duplicate companies, or mismatches?

**Key Points**: Native Workspaces; "configure to fit our business"; Modal quote; single source of truth; Segment integration.

### Step 3: Demo
**Demo Flow**: Workspaces object and relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) → Segment (or similar) syncing product data into Attio → one view: company + people + workspaces + usage. Contrast with "how you'd do this in HubSpot" (workarounds).

### Step 4: Close
**Proposal**: Attio Pro (or Plus for pilot); migration from HubSpot (we import); Modal story and reference if needed.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're invested in HubSpot" | "Modal was too. They hit a wall on workspaces—no native support. We import from HubSpot so you bring your data; you gain a CRM that fits PLG." |
| "Migration risk" | "Modal switched and got native Workspaces and clean data. We have import guides; can run in parallel during pilot." |
| "Our team won't adopt" | "Modal said Attio is 'a delight to work in' and they 'genuinely feel happy'—almost unheard of in CRM. Adoption followed." |
