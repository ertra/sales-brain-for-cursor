# Investor / Deal Flow - Pain Points

## Overview
Investors and deal-flow teams track deals and companies in spreadsheets or tools built for sales. They lack a single source of truth, a data model that fits investing (funds, deals, companies, relationships), and the ability to scale pipeline visibility without losing control.

## Pain Points

### 1. Deals and companies in spreadsheets or wrong-shaped tools
- **Description**: Pipeline lives in spreadsheets or a CRM built for sales (Contacts, Opportunities). There's no native concept of Fund, Deal (investment amount, stage), or the right company/contact associations; they work around the tool or stay in Excel.
- **Impact**: No single source of truth; hard to report and collaborate; version control and access issues; doesn't scale as deal flow grows.
- **Current Solutions**: Excel/Sheets; Airtable; or force-fitting a sales CRM with custom fields.
- **Frequency**: Daily (every deal and update)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio data model (custom objects: Fund, Deal, Company, Person; attributes for investment amount, stage, etc.); built for "deal flow" and "investing at scale."
- **Key Message**: "Build the perfect deal engine. Your data model—funds, deals, companies—reflected in your CRM, not in a spreadsheet."

### 2. Siloed data across partners and tools
- **Description**: Deal and relationship data is fragmented—each partner or associate has their own view; sourcing tools, email, and CRM don't connect. Turning "siloed data into a source of truth" feels impossible.
- **Impact**: No unified pipeline view; duplicate or conflicting data; hard to collaborate and report; leadership can't see the full picture.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual syncs; shared drives; or accept silos.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio (one workspace, one data model); activity timelines and enrichment; optional workflows to sync and notify; "from fragmented to unified" (USV case study).
- **Key Message**: "From fragmented to unified—USV turned siloed data into a source of truth with Attio. One place for every deal and relationship."

### 3. Pipeline visibility and reporting don't scale
- **Description**: As deal flow grows, reporting (by stage, source, partner, fund) becomes painful. Spreadsheets break; generic CRM reports don't fit; they need to "group their way" and drill down without exporting.
- **Impact**: Slow or manual reporting; can't answer "what's in the pipeline?" quickly; limited historical and trend view.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual reports; exports to Sheets or BI; or accept limited visibility.
- **Frequency**: Weekly/Monthly (partner meetings, LP updates)
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Attio Reporting (real-time; group, segment, historical, targets; dashboards; collaborative); scales with data (millions of records, sub-50ms).
- **Key Message**: "Pipeline and deal flow reporting that scales—real-time, flexible, and built on your data model. No more export hell."

## Discovery Questions
1. Where do you track deals and companies today—spreadsheets, a CRM, or something else? What's missing?
2. How do partners and associates stay aligned on pipeline—one source of truth or multiple?
3. When you need to report on pipeline (e.g. by stage, source, fund), how do you do it today—and how long does it take?
