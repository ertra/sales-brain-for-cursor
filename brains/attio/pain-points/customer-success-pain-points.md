# Customer Success - Pain Points

## Overview
CS teams lack a single view of account context before calls, suffer from manual handoffs from sales, and can't easily see health and product engagement in one place. They need prep that pulls from the full relationship and workflows that automate handoffs and risk signals.

## Pain Points

### 1. No single view of account before customer calls
- **Description**: Context is split across sales CRM, support tickets, product usage, and notes. CSMs spend time digging before QBRs and check-ins; they miss renewal risks or expansion signals that are "somewhere else."
- **Impact**: Underprepared for calls; missed expansion or churn signals; duplicate questions to the customer; slow ramp for new CSMs.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual prep docs, switching between tools, or asking sales/support for context.
- **Frequency**: Daily (every customer touchpoint)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Ask Attio (QBR prep, onboarding prep, product engagement summary); activity timelines; one record with full history and enrichment.
- **Key Message**: "Show up to every customer call with full context—QBR prep, product engagement, and relationship history in one place."

### 2. Manual and inconsistent handoffs from sales
- **Description**: When a deal closes, CS often gets a spreadsheet or a partial handoff. Deal context, next steps, and commitments don't automatically flow into CS workflow; CS rebuilds the picture.
- **Impact**: Slow time-to-value for new customers; dropped commitments; duplicate work; customer feels the handoff.
- **Current Solutions**: Handoff meetings, shared docs, or manual creation of CS records; no single system of record.
- **Frequency**: Per won deal (weekly/monthly depending on volume)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio Workflows (pass deals to CS, closed-won notification, renewal date autofill); same CRM for sales and CS; activity and notes carry over.
- **Key Message**: "Won deal triggers an instant handoff to CS—all context, next steps, and renewal tracking in one CRM. No more spreadsheets."

### 3. Health and renewal visibility scattered
- **Description**: Renewal dates, health scores, and usage data live in different tools. CS can't easily see "who's at risk" or "who's ready to expand" without exports and manual work.
- **Impact**: Surprise churn; missed expansion; reactive instead of proactive; leadership can't see CS pipeline.
- **Current Solutions**: Spreadsheets, separate CS tools, or product analytics exports; manual reconciliation.
- **Frequency**: Weekly/Monthly (renewal and health reviews)
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Attio data model (custom attributes for health, renewal); Workflows (renewal autofill, churn reminders); Reporting (segment by plan, usage, tenure; dashboards).
- **Key Message**: "Health and renewals in the same place as the relationship. Automate reminders and see risk before it's too late."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| No single view before calls | High | Daily | Ask Attio, Data | QBR prep, product engagement, one record |

## Discovery Questions
1. How do you prep for a QBR or important customer call today—where does the context come from?
2. When a deal closes, how does the customer and deal context get to CS—and how long does it take?
3. Where do you track renewal dates and health—and how do you make sure nothing slips?

## Trigger Events
- Churn that could have been caught with better visibility
- New CS hire and handoff process is unclear or manual
- Leadership asking for CS pipeline or health reporting
