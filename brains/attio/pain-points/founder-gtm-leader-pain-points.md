# Founder / GTM Leader - Pain Points

## Overview
Founders and GTM leaders are frustrated by CRMs that are overcomplicated, expensive, and force the business to "bend to their will." They want one system for sales, onboarding, and CS that scales from zero to IPO without constant rip-and-replace, and that supports non-sales use cases like fundraising and recruiting.

## Pain Points

### 1. CRM is overcomplicated, expensive, and prescriptive
- **Description**: Legacy CRMs feel heavy—long implementation, rigid workflows, and high cost. Leaders hear "you have to bend to their will, not the other way around"; they don't want to wait months or pay enterprise pricing before seeing value.
- **Impact**: Delayed GTM build-out; team resists using the tool; budget blown on a system that doesn't fit; iteration is slow.
- **Current Solutions**: Use spreadsheets longer; adopt a "lighter" tool that later can't scale; or accept complexity.
- **Frequency**: At selection and ongoing (every change)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio platform (Free to start, no credit card; 14-day Pro trial); "infinitely flexible"; real-time sync from day one; "from zero to IPO."
- **Key Message**: "Start today. No credit card. Build the exact CRM your business needs—flexible and simple, without the enterprise tax."

### 2. Need one system for sales, onboarding, and CS—not three
- **Description**: Sales runs in CRM, onboarding in docs or another tool, CS in yet another. Leaders want one GTM engine: pipelines, customer onboarding processes, and customer success in the same place so the team and data don't fragment.
- **Impact**: Duplicate data; broken handoffs; no single view of the customer journey; harder to scale process.
- **Current Solutions**: Integrations between tools; manual handoffs; or accept that "sales CRM" and "CS tool" are separate.
- **Frequency**: Daily (handoffs, reporting)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio (one platform for pipelines, workflows, reporting); same data model and records for sales and CS; workflows for handoffs (pass deals to CS, onboarding flows).
- **Key Message**: "One world-class GTM engine—sales pipelines, customer onboarding, and customer success. There's nothing like it in the market." — Taimur Abdaal, Co-Founder & CTO

### 3. Use cases beyond sales (fundraising, recruiting) don't fit
- **Description**: Founders use the same discipline (pipeline, relationships, follow-up) for fundraising and recruiting. Standard CRM only does "deals"; they end up with spreadsheets or separate tools for investors and candidates.
- **Impact**: Fragmented relationship data; no single place for "who we're talking to" across sales, fundraising, recruiting; missed follow-ups.
- **Current Solutions**: Spreadsheets; separate ATS or investor tracker; or force fundraising/recruiting into deal fields.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (fundraising cycles; hiring)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: Attio data model (custom objects for any entity—investors, candidates, partnerships); one flexible CRM for sales, fundraising, recruiting.
- **Key Message**: "We use Attio for sales, fundraising, and recruiting. It's awesome." — Dimitry Gershenson. One CRM that adapts to every pipeline.

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| CRM overcomplicated/prescriptive | High | At selection, ongoing | Platform, Free/Pro trial | Start free; flexible; "balance of flexibility and prescriptiveness" |

## Discovery Questions
1. When you evaluated your current CRM, what did you have to compromise on—and how fast did you get value?
2. Where do onboarding and customer success live today—same system as sales or separate? How do handoffs work?
3. Do you track fundraising or recruiting in a pipeline today—and if so, where?

## Trigger Events
- Scaling from founder-led sales to first sales/CS hires and need one process
- Preparing for fundraise or hiring push and want one place for relationships
- Frustration with current CRM ("most CRMs suck") and open to change
