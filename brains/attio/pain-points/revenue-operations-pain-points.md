# Revenue Operations - Pain Points

## Overview
RevOps struggles with CRMs that force a fixed schema, data silos between product/billing and CRM, and automations that require heavy engineering or don't support complex logic. They need one flexible data model, real-time sync, and reporting that scales with the business.

## Pain Points

### 1. CRM schema doesn't match our business model
- **Description**: Standard objects (Contact, Opportunity) don't map to workspaces, funds, partnerships, or product-led motions. RevOps spends months on workarounds, custom objects that don't scale, or migration every time the business evolves.
- **Impact**: Slow iteration; data in wrong shape for reporting and workflows; "we configure our CRM to fit the business" becomes impossible; team loses trust in CRM.
- **Current Solutions**: Custom objects where allowed, spreadsheets for the rest; or accept that CRM is "good enough" and don't model reality.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing (every new motion or object)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio data model (custom objects, attributes, associations, graph); build for any business (PLG, deal flow, sales); millions of records, sub-50ms; iterate without migration hell.
- **Key Message**: "Your business model—perfectly reflected in your CRM. Custom objects, any associations. No more bending to someone else's schema."

### 2. Data silos — product, billing, and engagement not in CRM
- **Description**: Product usage, billing, and engagement data live in data warehouses, Segment, or separate tools. RevOps can't get a single source of truth; routing, scoring, and reporting require manual syncs or brittle ETL.
- **Impact**: Stale or duplicate data; workflows can't trigger on product events; reporting is delayed or wrong; GTM decisions based on incomplete picture.
- **Current Solutions**: Reverse ETL, CDPs, or custom pipelines; often still not real-time or not fully in CRM.
- **Frequency**: Daily (every report and workflow)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio data & sync (data warehouses, reverse ETL, CDPs; email/calendar sync; enrichment); "no silos"; real-time single source of truth.
- **Key Message**: "Unify product, billing, and engagement data in Attio—real-time. One source of truth for routing, workflows, and reporting."

### 3. Building and maintaining automations is slow or brittle
- **Description**: Complex workflows (e.g. route by segment, classify leads, trigger on product events) need code or multiple tools. Visual builders are limited; AI or unstructured data is out of reach. RevOps becomes bottleneck.
- **Impact**: Manual processes that don't scale; long implementation cycles; automations break when schema or tools change.
- **Current Solutions**: Zapier/Make plus CRM; developer time; or accept manual steps.
- **Frequency**: Weekly/Monthly (every new process or change)
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Attio Workflows (visual canvas, triggers, actions, AI blocks); integrate Slack, Typeform, Outreach, webhooks; classify and summarize in workflow; templates to start fast.
- **Key Message**: "Automate the way you want—complex logic, AI in the flow, and your stack connected. No code required; iterate in days not months."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Schema doesn't match business | High | Ongoing | Data model | Any objects, any model; scale-ups to investors |
| Data silos | High | Daily | Data & sync | Warehouses, CDPs, email/calendar; real-time |
| Automations slow/brittle | Medium–High | Weekly/Monthly | Workflows | Visual + AI + integrations; templates |

## Discovery Questions
1. How does your current CRM data model compare to how you actually run GTM—workspaces, deal types, product data?
2. Where does product and billing data live today, and how does it get into the CRM (if at all)?
3. What's the last automation you built or changed—how long did it take, and who had to be involved?

## Trigger Events
- New GTM motion (e.g. PLG, deal flow) that doesn't fit current CRM
- Leadership asking for a "single source of truth" or better reporting
- RevOps drowning in manual syncs or broken workflows
