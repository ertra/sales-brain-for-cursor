# Sales Rep (AE / SDR) - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales reps waste time hunting for context before calls, doing manual CRM updates, and working in a CRM that doesn't match how they sell. They need to prep fast, keep deals accurate, and have one place for "everything I need to know" before every meeting.

## Pain Points

### 1. Context scattered across tools before every call
- **Description**: Deal and contact context lives in email, calendar, notes, Slack, and product usage. Reps copy-paste and switch tabs to prep; they risk missing key info or showing up underprepared.
- **Impact**: Weaker first impressions; missed objections or next steps; slower close; reps feel unprepared and stressed.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual note-taking, spreadsheets, or separate "prep" docs; some use AI assistants that aren't grounded in CRM.
- **Frequency**: Daily (every meeting)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Ask Attio (meeting prep, deal brief, daily brief, recap call); Universal Context; permissions enforced so they only see allowed data.
- **Key Message**: "Before every meeting, Attio centralizes and surfaces everything you need to know—real information from your CRM, not AI invention."

### 2. CRM feels like data entry, not intelligence
- **Description**: Updating deal stage, next step, and activity is manual and tedious. CRM doesn't suggest or automate updates; reps delay data entry and pipeline becomes stale.
- **Impact**: Stale pipeline and forecast; leadership can't trust the data; reps avoid the CRM; reporting is wrong.
- **Current Solutions**: Batch updates, reminders, or accepting dirty data; some use separate automation tools that don't live in CRM.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Ask Attio (update deal/next step from natural language; update deal from call); Workflows (auto-update on triggers); activity timelines and enrichment so records stay current.
- **Key Message**: "Update deals and next steps in seconds—approve a suggestion from Attio or say it in plain language. Your CRM stays accurate without the grind."

### 3. CRM doesn't fit how we sell (e.g. PLG, multi-workspace)
- **Description**: Legacy CRM is built for a single pipeline and rigid stages. Reps selling into product-led or multi-workspace accounts can't see usage, workspaces, or the right objects; they work around the tool.
- **Impact**: Wrong prioritization; missed expansion signals; deals tracked in spreadsheets or other tools; frustration with "bending to the CRM's will."
- **Current Solutions**: Custom fields, spreadsheets, or separate product/usage tools; workarounds that don't scale.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Attio data model (custom objects, workspaces, associations); product and billing sync; reporting that reflects their pipeline and segments.
- **Key Message**: "Attio adapts to your business—model workspaces, product usage, and deals the way you actually sell. No more bending to the CRM."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Context scattered before calls | High | Daily | Ask Attio | Grounded in your data; permissions; human-in-the-loop |
| CRM = data entry, not intelligence | High | Daily | Ask Attio, Workflows | Native updates, recap→deal update, suggestions |
| CRM doesn't fit our motion | Medium–High | Weekly | Data model, Reporting | Custom objects, product sync, "from zero to IPO" flexibility |

## Discovery Questions
1. How much time do you spend prepping for each call, and where do you pull context from today?
2. When you get off a call, how do you update the deal and next steps—and how often does it slip?
3. Does your current CRM reflect how you actually sell (e.g. workspaces, product usage, deal types)—or do you work around it?

## Trigger Events
- Lost deal or bad call that could have been avoided with better prep
- Leadership complaining about pipeline accuracy or stale data
- Scaling team and can't keep everyone on the same process
