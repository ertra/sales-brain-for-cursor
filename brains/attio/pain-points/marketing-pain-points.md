# Marketing - Pain Points

## Overview
Marketing teams struggle with lead and campaign data disconnected from CRM, manual routing and triage, and attribution/reporting that requires exports. They need automated lead routing, product and engagement signals in the same place as CRM, and full-funnel visibility in one platform.

## Pain Points

### 1. Lead and campaign data disconnected from CRM
- **Description**: Leads come from forms, ads, and product; they live in a marketing or product tool. CRM has contacts and deals but not the full journey—source, segment, score, or product usage. Marketing can't see lead→opportunity→revenue in one place.
- **Impact**: No single view of funnel; manual sync or duplicate data; routing and scoring are guesswork; attribution is delayed or wrong.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual uploads; point integrations that only sync basic fields; or accept that "marketing data" and "CRM" are separate.
- **Frequency**: Daily (every campaign and lead)
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio data model (custom attributes for source, segment, score); Workflows (trigger from Typeform, Segment, webhooks); data sync (product, billing); one source of truth.
- **Key Message**: "Unify lead and campaign data with your CRM—Segment, forms, and product data in real time. One funnel, one source of truth."

### 2. Manual and slow lead routing and triage
- **Description**: Inbound and product-led leads need to be routed (e.g. enterprise vs SMB) and triaged. Today it's manual assignment, round-robin, or brittle rules; high-intent leads wait too long and go cold.
- **Impact**: Slow speed-to-lead; lost pipeline; reps get wrong or too many leads; marketing can't prove impact.
- **Current Solutions**: Manual assignment; simple round-robin; or separate routing tool that doesn't share full context with CRM.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Attio Workflows (MQL routing, lead form triggers, Segment events); route by attribute (segment, size, source); add to sequences; same CRM so sales has full context.
- **Key Message**: "83% faster lead triage—Granola turned product signals into revenue at scale with Attio. Route and nurture in one place."

### 3. Attribution and funnel reporting require exports
- **Description**: To answer "which channel or campaign drove pipeline?" marketing exports from CRM and marketing tools, then merges in Sheets or BI. No real-time "segment by" or drill-down in the CRM; reporting lags and is labor-intensive.
- **Impact**: Delayed or incomplete attribution; can't iterate on campaigns quickly; hard to show marketing ROI to leadership.
- **Current Solutions**: Exports, spreadsheets, or separate BI; often not real-time or not tied to CRM records.
- **Frequency**: Weekly/Monthly (reporting cycles)
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: Attio Reporting (real-time; segment by source, channel, segment; historical and targets); data model holds source/segment on every record; dashboards and collaboration.
- **Key Message**: "Full-funnel reporting in the CRM—segment by channel, source, and segment. Real-time, no export. Prove what's working."

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Lead/campaign data disconnected | High | Daily | Data model, Workflows, Sync | Segment, forms, product in one CRM; real-time |
| Manual routing/triage | High | Daily | Workflows | MQL routing, triggers, sequences; Granola 83% faster triage |
| Attribution/reporting exports | Medium–High | Weekly/Monthly | Reporting, Data | Real-time segment by; dashboards; no export |

## Discovery Questions
1. When a lead comes in from your site or product, where does it go first—and how does it get into the CRM with the right context?
2. How do you decide which rep or team gets a lead today—and how long does it take from lead to first touch?
3. How do you report on which channels and campaigns drive pipeline—and how long does that take each month?

## Trigger Events
- Scaling lead volume and manual routing is breaking
- Leadership asking for marketing attribution or funnel visibility
- Sales complaining about lead quality or speed of assignment
