# Founder / GTM Leader - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from founders and GTM leaders: "we're too small," "not now," "our CRM is good enough," and "we'll evaluate later." Use with [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, competition.

## Objections

### 1. "We're too small / we'll look when we scale"

**Why They Say This**: Don't want to over-invest; or assume Attio is for bigger teams only.

**Acknowledge**: "Every startup has to pick where to invest first. No one wants to overbuy."

**Respond**: "Attio is built for exactly that—from zero to IPO. You can start free, no credit card, and run your whole GTM in one place: sales, onboarding, customer success. Founders use it for sales, fundraising, and recruiting in the same CRM. So you're not buying for 'when we scale'—you're getting one CRM that scales with you, so you never have to rip and replace. Jono Bacon said most CRMs 'suck' and you 'bend to their will'; Attio is the one he's a fan of because it's 'flexible and simple.' Dimitry Gershenson uses Attio for sales, fundraising, and recruiting—'it's awesome.' Start free; when you grow, you're already on the right foundation."

**Proof Point**:
- "From zero to IPO"; "real-time CRM for scaling startups"; Free to start, no credit card
- Jono Bacon: "flexible and simple"; Dimitry Gershenson: "sales, fundraising, and recruiting… it's awesome"
- Startup solution: "every stage of the startup journey"

**Follow-Up Question**: "If you could have one CRM that works today and still works when you 10x, would that change when you'd look?"

### 2. "Now's not the right time / we're in fundraising / we're hiring"

**Why They Say This**: Other priorities; or using timing to defer.

**Acknowledge**: "Founders are always juggling. Fundraising and hiring are all-consuming."

**Respond**: "That's actually when Attio helps. You can run fundraising and recruiting in the same CRM as sales—same pipeline discipline, one place for relationships. Dimitry said they use Attio for sales, fundraising, and recruiting. So you're not adding a project; you're using one system you might already need for pipeline. And you can start free—no budget approval, no commitment. When things calm down, you're already set up. Taimur Abdaal said they built a 'world-class go-to-market engine' from sales pipelines to onboarding to customer success with Attio; there's nothing like it. Getting that in place now means you're ready when you scale."

**Proof Point**:
- Free tier; no commitment
- Dimitry Gershenson: "sales, fundraising, and recruiting"
- Taimur Abdaal: "world-class GTM engine… sales pipelines to customer onboarding to customer success"

**Follow-Up Question**: "Would a free account and 30 minutes to set up one pipeline—sales or fundraising—be feasible this week?"

### 3. "Our current CRM is good enough for now"

**Why They Say This**: Don't see pain yet; or avoiding change; or "we'll fix it later."

**Acknowledge**: "If it's working, that's valuable. A lot of founders run lean."

**Respond**: "The teams that switched to Attio thought that too. Modal was on HubSpot and hit a wall when they needed workspaces and product data—floating records, duplicates, no native support. Flatfile was on Salesforce and hit sync chaos and lost opportunities—'death by a thousand cuts.' The cost of switching later is higher: you've built more workarounds and more team habit. Attio is free to start, so the question is whether you want the CRM that adapts to you from day one—'configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around'—or wait until you hit the wall. Alon said as an early-stage startup he's 'really loving' Attio for the 'balance of flexibility and prescriptiveness.'"

**Proof Point**:
- Modal: "good enough" until HubSpot couldn't do workspaces
- Flatfile: "good enough" until Salesforce limited growth
- Alon (testimonial): "early stage startup… really loving… balance of flexibility and prescriptiveness"
- Free to start

**Follow-Up Question**: "When you imagine doubling the team or adding a new motion, does your current CRM feel like it'll keep up—or will you hit the same wall Modal and Flatfile hit?"

---

### 4. "I need to focus on product / I'll let my team decide"

**Why They Say This**: Delegating CRM choice; or deprioritizing GTM tools; or genuine delegation.

**Acknowledge**: "Product and team come first. CRM can feel like a distraction."

**Respond**: "Makes sense. The reason to pick it once and get it right is so your team isn't stuck with something that doesn't fit in six months. Attio is the CRM that scales from zero to IPO—your GTM lead or RevOps can run it, and you get one place for pipeline, onboarding, and CS so you're not re-evaluating every year. We have case studies and a free tier; your team can try it and you can stay focused on product. If they love it—like Modal and Flatfile did—you've set them up. If they don't, no cost. We can send a one-pager and the free signup link so they can kick the tires."

**Proof Point**:
- Free tier; 14-day Pro trial; case studies (Modal, Flatfile, Granola)
- "From zero to IPO"; one CRM for sales, onboarding, CS
- Modal, Flatfile: team adoption and "delight to work in"

**Follow-Up Question**: "Who on your team would own the CRM decision—and what would they need to see to recommend Attio?"
