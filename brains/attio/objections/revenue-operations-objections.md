# Revenue Operations - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from RevOps when evaluating Attio: migration from Salesforce/HubSpot, "we've customized our CRM," implementation complexity, and security. Use with [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, competition.

## Objections

### 1. "We've customized Salesforce / HubSpot so much—we can't move"

**Why They Say This**: Sunk cost in config and integrations; fear of losing customizations; or believe no other CRM can match.

**Acknowledge**: "You've invested a lot in making it work. No one wants to throw that away."

**Respond**: "Attio is built for teams that outgrew rigid CRMs. Our data model is flexible by design—custom objects, any relationships—so you don't lose capability; you gain the ability to model your business without fighting the tool. Flatfile had sync chaos and duplicate records in Salesforce; they moved to Attio in about a month and got a single source of truth with a data model that 'just works' with everything downstream. Modal had customized HubSpot with workarounds for workspaces and still had floating records and mismatches; they switched to Attio and got native Workspaces and clean relationships. We import from Salesforce and HubSpot, so you bring your data. The question is whether you want to keep maintaining workarounds or have a CRM that's flexible by design."

**Proof Point**:
- Flatfile: migrated from Salesforce in ~1 month; "data model super powerful, relationships really flexible"; "connect to everything downstream, it all just works"
- Modal: left HubSpot workarounds for Attio; "configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around"
- Import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, CSV

**Follow-Up Question**: "What customizations are non-negotiable—and have we shown how you'd model those in Attio?"

### 2. "Migration and implementation will take too long / be too risky"

**Why They Say This**: Fear of project failure; past bad migrations; or assume big-bang only.

**Acknowledge**: "Migration risk is real. RevOps owns that risk."

**Respond**: "We're built to make migration predictable. We have structured import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, and CSV—so data comes over in a known way. Flatfile moved their entire CRM from Salesforce to Attio in about a month; they got consistent data capture and single source of truth. You can run a pilot in parallel—Attio Free or a sandbox—and validate the data model and workflows before cutover. Our help center has import and export guides. We can put together a phased plan: pilot, then migrate by object or team, so there's no big-bang surprise."

**Proof Point**:
- Flatfile: full CRM migration in ~1 month
- Help center: Imports & exports; migrate from another CRM
- Pilot in parallel; phased migration by object/team

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would a migration plan need to include for you to feel comfortable—timeline, phases, and rollback?"

### 3. "We need enterprise security and compliance"

**Why They Say This**: Requirement for SOC 2, GDPR, etc.; or procurement/legal bar.

**Acknowledge**: "Security and compliance are non-negotiable. Rightfully so."

**Respond**: "Attio is built for scale and trust. We're audited and certified—GDPR, CCPA, ISO—and we publish security information. Enterprise plan includes advanced security and admin, SSO, and options like payment by invoice and protected recipients. Our customers include scale-ups and enterprises that need to meet compliance; we don't cut corners on data protection and access control. Happy to share our security and compliance docs and connect you with our team for a deeper review if that's part of your process."

**Proof Point**:
- Company/product pages: GDPR, CCPA, ISO; "Scale with security"; "audited and certified"
- Enterprise: advanced security & admin, SSO, payment by invoice
- Help center: workspace settings, security, account settings

**Follow-Up Question**: "What specific certifications or controls does your security team need to see—we can provide the right materials."

---

### 4. "Our data model is too complex / Attio can't handle it"

**Why They Say This**: Believe only Salesforce or custom build can support their schema; or haven't seen Attio's flexibility.

**Acknowledge**: "Complex data models are hard. You need a CRM that can keep up."

**Respond**: "Attio's data model is built for complexity. Custom objects, custom attributes, and relationships—one-to-many, many-to-many—so you can model workspaces, deal flow, product-led, or any structure. Modal needed native Workspaces and clean relationships for PLG; they said Attio was the first CRM where they could 'configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around.' We handle millions of records with sub-50ms latency. Flatfile has complex customer and deal relationships; they said the data model is 'super powerful' and 'we can connect to everything downstream, and it all just works.' Happy to walk through your object model and show how it maps to Attio."

**Proof Point**:
- Modal: Workspaces, "configure our CRM to fit our business needs"
- Flatfile: "data model super powerful"; "relationships really flexible"; "connect to everything downstream, it all just works"
- Scale: millions of records, sub-50ms; custom objects for any business model

**Follow-Up Question**: "Can you walk me through your core objects and relationships—we can map them in Attio and show it side by side."
