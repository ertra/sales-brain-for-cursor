# Common Objections - Objection Handling

## Overview
Cross-persona objections that come up in Attio sales conversations: price, timing, competition (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive), migration, status quo, and authority. Use these responses with persona-specific objection docs when needed.

## Objections

### 1. Price/Budget: "We don't have budget for a new CRM"

**Why They Say This**: Assume Attio is additive; don't yet see replacement or ROI; or genuine constraint.

**Acknowledge**: "Budget is real. No one wants to add cost without clear return."

**Respond**: "Attio often replaces what you're spending elsewhere. Start for free—no credit card—and run a 14-day Pro trial. If you're on Salesforce or HubSpot, we import from both; Flatfile moved their entire CRM to Attio in about a month and got single source of truth without sync chaos. Plus you're not layering another tool—you're getting one CRM that adapts to your business, so you can cut workarounds and duplicate tools. We can map your current CRM and tool spend and show the comparison."

**Proof Point**:
- Free tier; 14-day Pro trial; no credit card (attio.com)
- Flatfile: full migration from Salesforce in ~1 month; "single source of truth for all GTM"
- Import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, CSV

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are you spending today on CRM and the tools you use to work around it? We can show the comparison."

---

### 2. Timing: "Not the right time / we're in the middle of quarter"

**Why They Say This**: Focus on number; fear of disruption; or deferring decision.

**Acknowledge**: "Quarter focus makes sense. No one wants to disrupt the team mid-cycle."

**Respond**: "You don't have to switch overnight. Start with Attio Free—no approval needed—and run it alongside what you have. When your current CRM renewal comes up, that's the natural moment to migrate; we import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive. Flatfile did a full move in about a month. Waiting often means another year of sync issues, duplicate records, or a CRM that doesn't fit—Modal and Flatfile both said their previous CRM was limiting growth. A pilot or Free tier costs nothing and proves fit before you commit."

**Proof Point**:
- Free tier; 14-day Pro trial; import from major CRMs
- Flatfile: full CRM migration in ~1 month
- Modal: "PLG hindered by HubSpot"; Flatfile: "growth limited by Salesforce"

**Follow-Up Question**: "When does your current CRM contract renew? We can time a pilot or migration to that."

---

### 3. Competition: "We're on Salesforce / HubSpot / Pipedrive"

**Why They Say This**: Incumbent relationship; haven't considered switching; or doing due diligence.

**Acknowledge**: "A lot of teams start there. So did Modal and Flatfile."

**Respond**: "We're not asking you to rip and replace on day one. We import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, and CSV—so you can try Attio with your data. Modal left HubSpot because they needed a CRM that could represent workspaces and product-led data; they said HubSpot had no native support and they ended up with floating records and duplicates. Flatfile left Salesforce because sync created chaos and they were losing high-profile opportunities; they moved to Attio in about a month and got a single source of truth. If your current CRM fits and scales with you, great. If you're hitting limits—rigid data model, sync issues, or lost deals—we're built for that. Happy to show the import path and a side-by-side."

**Proof Point**:
- Import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive (help/imports)
- Modal: left HubSpot for Attio (PLG, workspaces); Flatfile: left Salesforce (sync chaos, migration in ~1 month)
- Granola: 83% faster lead triage with Attio

**Follow-Up Question**: "What's working with [current CRM], and where are you running into limits—data model, sync, or reporting?"

---

### 4. Migration: "Migration would be too painful / we can't afford downtime"

**Why They Say This**: Fear of project failure, data loss, or team disruption.

**Acknowledge**: "Migration is a real concern. No one wants to lose data or disrupt the team."

**Respond**: "We're built to make migration straightforward. We import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, and CSV—so your data comes over in a structured way. Flatfile moved their entire CRM from Salesforce to Attio in about a month; they got consistent data capture and single source of truth without the sync chaos they had before. You can run Attio in parallel during a pilot, then cut over when you're ready. Our help center has step-by-step import guides, and we can walk through a migration plan so there's no surprise."

**Proof Point**:
- Flatfile: full CRM migration from Salesforce in ~1 month
- Help center: Imports & exports; migrate from another CRM (attio.com/help)
- Import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Excel, CSV

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would a successful migration look like for you—timeline, data scope, and who needs to be involved?"

---

### 5. Status Quo: "We're fine with what we have"

**Why They Say This**: Don't see the problem; change is hard; or comfortable with current setup.

**Acknowledge**: "If it's working, that's valuable. A lot of teams don't look until something breaks."

**Respond**: "We hear that. Modal and Flatfile thought they were 'fine' until they hit a wall—Modal couldn't model workspaces in HubSpot and had floating records and duplicates; Flatfile had sync chaos and was losing high-profile opportunities. The question is whether your CRM will still be fine when you double the team or change your motion. Attio is built to adapt—from zero to IPO, one CRM. You can start free and see if the flexibility and single source of truth matter for you. No commitment."

**Proof Point**:
- Modal: "fine" until PLG and workspaces didn't fit HubSpot
- Flatfile: "fine" until "death by a thousand cuts" and lost opportunities
- "From zero to IPO"; Free to start

**Follow-Up Question**: "When you think about scaling or changing your GTM motion, does your current CRM feel like it'll keep up—or will you hit limits?"

---

### 6. Authority: "I need to check with my boss / RevOps / IT"

**Why They Say This**: Genuine need for buy-in; or using as delay.

**Acknowledge**: "Getting alignment is important. CRM touches a lot of people."

**Respond**: "Makes sense. We can help you make the case. We have case studies—Modal, Flatfile, Granola—that speak to PLG, single source of truth, and faster triage. We can put together a short summary: why teams switch, what they get (flexible data model, no sync chaos, Ask Attio for meeting prep), and that you can start free and import from your current CRM. If RevOps or IT is involved, we have security and compliance info—GDPR, CCPA, ISO—and import/migration docs. Happy to join a call with your boss or RevOps if that helps."

**Proof Point**:
- Case studies: Modal, Flatfile, Granola (customers page)
- Security: GDPR, CCPA, ISO (company/product pages)
- Help center: imports, workspace settings, security

**Follow-Up Question**: "Who else needs to be in the loop, and what would they need to see to feel comfortable?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "What are you spending today on CRM and the tools around it?"
2. "When does your current CRM contract renew?"
3. "Who's involved in the decision—and what do they care about most?"
4. "Where is your current CRM working well, and where are you running into limits?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- "We're locked in for another year" → focus on pilot/Free now, migration at renewal
- "We've customized [CRM] so much" → position Attio flexibility and migration path
- "Our team would never adopt something new" → share adoption (e.g. Granola 100%, Modal "delight to work in")
