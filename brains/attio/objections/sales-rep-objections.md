# Sales Rep (AE / SDR) - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from sales reps and AEs when evaluating Attio: "another tool," "we're fine with our process," "AI trust," and adoption. Use with [common-objections.md](common-objections.md) for price, timing, competition.

## Objections

### 1. "We already have a CRM / I don't want another tool"

**Why They Say This**: Tool fatigue; assume Attio is additive; don't see it as replacement.

**Acknowledge**: "No one wants more tabs to switch between. Reps are already stretched."

**Respond**: "Attio isn't another layer—it's the CRM. You'd replace what you use today, not add to it. We import from Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, so your data comes over. The difference is one place for pipeline, meeting prep, and deal updates: Ask Attio gives you everything you need before every call and lets you update deals in seconds. So you have one system, not CRM plus five workarounds. Modal and Flatfile switched from HubSpot and Salesforce because the old CRM didn't fit; their teams use Attio as the single place to work."

**Proof Point**:
- Import from major CRMs; Attio is the CRM, not an add-on
- Modal: "delight to work in"; Granola: 100% GTM adoption
- "Before every meeting, Ask Attio centralizes… everything I need to know" — Ian Ahuja, Head of Sales

**Follow-Up Question**: "How many places do you today go to prep for a call and update a deal? What if that was one place?"

### 2. "Our process works / we're fine with how we do things"

**Why They Say This**: Don't see pain; or fear change; or haven't seen what they're missing.

**Acknowledge**: "If it's working, that's real. A lot of reps are used to the current way."

**Respond**: "We're not here to change your process—we're here to make it faster. Ask Attio pulls context from your CRM and connected tools so prep is minutes, not hunting across email and Slack. You update deals by approving a suggestion or saying it in plain language instead of clicking through fields. Same process, less busywork. Granola's team saves 5 hours a week on automated deal updates and cut lead review from 2 hours to 20 minutes. You keep your process; you just get more time back and fresher pipeline."

**Proof Point**:
- Granola: 5 hrs/week saved (deal updates); 2h → 20min lead review; 83% faster triage
- Ask Attio: meeting prep, deal brief, update deal (approve or natural language)
- "Intelligent suggestions. Human decisions." — you stay in control

**Follow-Up Question**: "How much time do you spend prepping for calls and updating deals today—and would you want that to be faster?"

### 3. "I don't trust AI with my deals / I want to control my data"

**Why They Say This**: Worry about AI hallucination or losing control; compliance or accuracy concern.

**Acknowledge**: "Trust in AI is a real issue. You need to be able to rely on what you see."

**Respond**: "Ask Attio is built for that. Every answer is sourced from your actual CRM and connected tools—real information, not AI invention. Your permissions are enforced, so you only see what you're supposed to. And you're always in control: we give you intelligent suggestions, but you approve, modify, or reject. No automatic updates without you. So you get speed without losing accuracy or control. That's why we say 'real information, not AI invention' and 'your permissions, enforced.'"

**Proof Point**:
- Ask Attio: "Real information, not AI invention"; "Your permissions, enforced"
- "Intelligent suggestions. Human decisions." — approve, modify, reject
- Grounded in CRM and Universal Context (emails, calls, notes)

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would make you comfortable using AI for prep and updates—would 'always sourced from your data and always your approval' address that?"

---

### 4. "My team won't adopt another tool"

**Why They Say This**: Change management concern; past failed rollouts; or assume Attio is complex.

**Acknowledge**: "Adoption is everything. A CRM no one uses doesn't help."

**Respond**: "Attio tends to get adopted because it makes the rep's life easier—one place for prep and updates, less manual data entry. Granola has 100% GTM team adoption with daily usage. Modal said Attio is 'a delight to work in' and 'I genuinely feel happy when I'm in the product, which is almost unheard of in the CRM space.' You can start with a small pilot or Free tier so the team tries it with no commitment. Once reps see meeting prep in one place and deal updates in seconds, adoption usually follows."

**Proof Point**:
- Granola: 100% GTM team adoption, daily usage
- Margaret Shen, Modal: "delight to work in"; "genuinely feel happy"
- Free tier; 14-day Pro trial; pilot with no commitment

**Follow-Up Question**: "Would a 14-day trial with one pod or a few reps be feasible—so they can try it and you can see adoption before rolling out?"
