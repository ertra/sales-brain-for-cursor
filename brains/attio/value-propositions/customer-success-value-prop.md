# Attio → Customer Success Value Proposition

## Summary
For Customer Success, Attio means one CRM with sales and CS in the same place—full context before every call, automatic handoffs from won deals, and health/renewal visibility without spreadsheets. Ask Attio delivers QBR prep, onboarding prep, and product engagement summary; workflows pass deals to CS and automate renewal and churn reminders. Show up prepared; never drop a handoff.

## The Problem
No single view of account before calls; manual and inconsistent handoffs from sales; health and renewal data scattered across tools.

## The Solution
Same Attio workspace for sales and CS. Ask Attio surfaces QBR prep, onboarding prep, and product engagement in one place. Workflows trigger on won deal to pass context to CS, autofill renewal dates, and remind on churn risk. Custom attributes and reporting for health and renewals; activity timelines carry the full relationship history.
