# Attio → Founder / GTM Leader Value Proposition

## Summary
For founders and GTM leaders, Attio is the CRM that scales from zero to IPO without rip-and-replace—flexible, simple, and built for how you actually run GTM. One system for sales pipelines, customer onboarding, and customer success; start free, no credit card; adapt the data model for fundraising and recruiting too. "The most flexible CRM we've ever come across."

## The Problem
Legacy CRMs are overcomplicated, expensive, and prescriptive—"bend to their will." Leaders need one system for sales, onboarding, and CS; they also run fundraising and recruiting and want one place for relationships.

## The Solution
Attio delivers one platform from day one: pipelines, workflows, and reporting that fit your motion. Free to start; 14-day Pro trial. Custom data model for any use case—sales, onboarding, CS, fundraising, recruiting. Real-time sync and enrichment; "infinitely flexible" so you iterate without fighting the tool.

## Key Value Drivers

### 2. One GTM engine—sales, onboarding, CS

### 3. One CRM for sales, fundraising, recruiting

- **Proof Point**: Data model supports any entity; "Attio for Startups," "Attio for Deal flow."
- **Customer Quote**: "We use our CRM @attio for sales, fundraising, and recruiting. It's awesome." — Dimitry Gershenson
