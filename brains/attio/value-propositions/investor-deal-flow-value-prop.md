# Attio → Investor / Deal Flow Value Proposition

## Summary
For investors and deal-flow teams, Attio is the CRM that becomes your deal engine—custom data model for funds, deals, and companies; one source of truth so siloed data becomes unified; reporting that scales with your pipeline. "From fragmented to unified." Build the perfect deal engine without spreadsheets.

## The Problem
Deals and companies live in spreadsheets or a sales CRM that doesn't fit; data is siloed across partners and tools; pipeline reporting doesn't scale.

## The Solution
Attio's data model supports custom objects (Fund, Deal, Company, Person) with the attributes you need—investment amount, stage, etc. One workspace for the whole team; activity timelines and enrichment. Reporting is real-time, flexible, and scales to millions of records. Workflows can automate updates and notifications.

## Key Value Drivers

### 3. Pipeline reporting that scales

- **Customer Quote**: (From reporting page) "The reporting engine for go-to-market teams. Access, visualize and explore all your data as quickly as you can think."
