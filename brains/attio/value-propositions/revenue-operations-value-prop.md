# Attio → Revenue Operations Value Proposition

## Summary
For RevOps, Attio means one CRM that reflects your business model, real-time data from product and billing in the same place as CRM, and workflows that automate complex GTM logic without months of engineering. Build any data model (PLG, deal flow, sales); unify warehouses, CDPs, and email/calendar; design automations with a visual canvas and AI. Single source of truth, sub-50ms at millions of records, GDPR/CCPA/ISO.

## The Problem
CRM schema doesn't match the business; data silos between product, billing, and CRM; building automations is slow or brittle; reporting requires exports and external BI.

## The Solution
Attio's adaptive data model lets you define custom objects and associations for any motion. Sync product, billing, and engagement data in real time (warehouses, reverse ETL, CDPs, email/calendar). Workflows offer triggers, actions, AI blocks, and integrations (Slack, Typeform, Outreach, webhooks). Reporting is real-time, flexible, and collaborative—group your way, drill down, no export.
