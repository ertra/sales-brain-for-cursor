# Attio → Sales Rep (AE / SDR) Value Proposition

## Summary
For sales reps and AEs, Attio means showing up to every call with full context and updating deals without the grind. Ask Attio centralizes meeting prep, deal briefs, and daily briefs from your actual CRM data—real information, not AI invention—with permissions enforced. Win faster when every call is perfectly prepped; keep pipeline accurate with natural-language updates and suggestions you approve or modify.

## The Problem
Context is scattered across email, calendar, notes, and Slack. Reps waste time prepping and risk missing key info. CRM updates are manual and tedious; pipeline goes stale. Legacy CRM doesn't fit how they sell (e.g. PLG, workspaces).

## The Solution
Ask Attio delivers meeting prep, deal brief, recap call, and daily brief grounded in your CRM and connected tools (Universal Context). Update deal stage and next steps via natural language or one-click suggestions. Workflows and sequences automate routing and follow-up. One flexible data model so the CRM reflects your motion.

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Prep for every call in minutes
- **Benefit**: One place for everything you need to know—emails, calls, notes, product usage—before every meeting.
- **Proof Point**: Ask Attio meeting prep, deal brief, daily brief; semantic search at scale; multilingual.
- **Customer Quote**: "Before every meeting, Ask Attio centralizes, summarizes, and surfaces everything I need to know to give a great first impression or close the deal." — Ian Ahuja, Head of Sales

### 2. Update deals without the data-entry grind
- **Benefit**: Approve or modify AI suggestions; update deal/next step from natural language or from a call recap.
- **Proof Point**: Real information from CRM; permissions enforced; human in the loop (approve, modify, reject).
- **Customer Quote**: (From site) "Intelligent suggestions. Human decisions. You're always in command."

### 3. CRM that fits how you sell
- **Benefit**: Custom objects, workspaces, product data in the same place as deals; no more bending to a rigid schema.
- **Proof Point**: Data model for any business (PLG, PLS, sales-led); activity timelines; enrichment on every record.
- **Customer Quote**: "It finally felt like I could configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around." — Margaret Shen, Head of Business Operations, Modal
