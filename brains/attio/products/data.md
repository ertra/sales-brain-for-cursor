# Data Model & Syncing

## Company
Attio

## Overview
Attio’s data model and syncing give you the "data model for go-to-market magic": model your structure, get automatic enrichment, and sync from integrations. Blazingly fast, amazingly flexible — complete control to build the perfect CRM.

## Main Features
- **Flexible data model** — Build for any business model: investors, partners, products, marketplaces, PLG, sales. Custom objects (e.g. Partnership, Invoices, Buyer, Seller, Transaction, Workspace, Fund); standard objects (Company, Person, Deal, User). Custom attributes; associations and graph model.
- **Performance** — Sort, filter, and use millions of records in milliseconds; iterate faster than ever.
- **Context that stays current** — Custom attributes; activity timelines (full interaction history); detailed views (kanbans, tables).
- **Automatic enrichment** — Every record enriched: company (name, description, logo, category, social, location, employee count, ARR, funding); people (name, description, profile picture, social, location). Customer conversations in context; data-powered workflows.
- **Unify data sources** — Data warehouses (reverse ETL, CDPs; product, user, billing in real-time); email and calendar sync; sales engagement tools. "No silos."

## Problem Solved
CRMs often force a fixed schema and slow, brittle integrations. Attio lets you reflect your business in the CRM and keep a single, real-time source of truth across product, billing, and engagement data.

## Value Proposition
"It finally felt like I could configure our CRM to fit our business needs, rather than the other way around." — Margaret Shen, Head of Business Operations, Modal. Unify business, customer, and product data to supercharge GTM.

## Target Customers
Scale-ups, SaaS (PLG/PLS), SMBs, investors; any team that needs a CRM that matches their data and processes.
