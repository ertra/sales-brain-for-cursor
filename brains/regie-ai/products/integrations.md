# Integrations

## Company
Regie.ai

## Overview
Regie integrates with the core systems sales and RevOps teams already use: CRM (Salesforce), Sales Engagement Platforms (Outreach, SalesLoft), and data/signals. AI Agents can augment Outreach or SalesLoft; RegieOne can replace them and consolidate lead sourcing, enrichment, signals, dialing, and email in one platform. All activity syncs to Salesforce.

## Main Features
- **Salesforce** – List building from Salesforce; AI agents log every touch; CRM updates automatically; sync sequences, calls, and tasks
- **Outreach** – AI Agents package integrates with Outreach; can run alongside or migrate sequences into RegieOne
- **SalesLoft** – AI Agents package integrates with SalesLoft; same path to RegieOne
- **Data & signals** – 220+ million contacts (verified mobile); 100+ built-in signals (Google, web, LinkedIn, 10-K, G2, Crunchbase, BuiltWith, company news, call transcripts, CRM); unlimited custom signals; waterfall enrichment across leading vendors
- **GDPR compliance** – Documented; see Customer Resources

## Problem Solved
- Stitching together dialer, enrichment, signals, and SEP; reps switching tabs and tools
- CRM data stale or inconsistent; duplicate list-building and manual updates
- Wanting AI outreach without ripping out existing SEP (Outreach/SalesLoft)

## Value Proposition
- Start with AI Agents + existing SEP (Outreach/SalesLoft), then optionally consolidate into RegieOne
- Single place for sequences, dialing, enrichment, and signals with full Salesforce sync
- Clean CRM data and automatic activity logging; no extra enrichment or signal tools required with RegieOne

## Target Customers
RevOps and sales leaders on Salesforce; teams on Outreach or SalesLoft evaluating AI layers or full platform consolidation.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| SEP-native only | Regie offers integration to Outreach/SalesLoft or full replacement (RegieOne) with built-in enrichment and signals |
| Best-of-breed data vendors | Enrichment and signals built into RegieOne; 220M contacts, 100+ signals, no extra fees per pricing FAQ |

## Pricing Model
Included in platform packages. Enrichment and built-in signals included in RegieOne (no extra fees per FAQ). Contact sales for AI Agents + Outreach/SalesLoft integration.

## Additional Notes
