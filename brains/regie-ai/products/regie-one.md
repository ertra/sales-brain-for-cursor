# RegieOne

## Company
Regie.ai

## Overview
RegieOne is the first AI-native Sales Engagement Platform (AI SEP). It unifies prospecting in one agentic AI platform: list building, enrichment, sequencing, signals, and calling—orchestrated by AI agents so reps stay focused on selling. It is the "antidote to legacy sales engagement," enabling greater reach, better conversations, and the same headcount.

## Main Features
- **One platform** – List building, enrichment, sequencing, signals, and calling in a single workflow (no juggling six tools)
- **AI-native SEP** with built-in modern sales dialer; single workflow from first touch to live call
- **AI prospecting agents** – Research accounts, find/enrich ICP contacts, write/send personalized emails, monitor buying signals, generate call tasks, drop voicemails, update CRM
- **Parallel and power dialing** with personalized AI voicemail drops; CRM updates automatically
- **Shared activity planner** – Impact of today’s activity on pipeline
- **Precision targeting** – 3–5x more call connects; automated multithreading; fresh, prioritized call lists daily
- **Real-time signal execution** – On job change or website visit, agents source ICP leads, add prospects, execute with contextual messaging
- **Adaptive sequences** – Timing, channel, and messaging adjust to engagement/intent; automatic slowdown to avoid over-contacting
- **Admin controls** – Set goals & personas; automate discovery & enrichment from Salesforce; prioritize with 1st/2nd/3rd-party intent and 30+ buying signals
- **Rep experience** – Tweak top-tier outreach or let agents engage lower-tier leads; AI-scored calls, analytics, conversion data

## Problem Solved
- Reps juggling multiple tools to run a single play; fragmented SEP and dialer/data/signals stack
- Inability to work entire TAM without adding headcount
- Static sequences and manual prioritization; missed signals and slow reaction to intent
- Pipeline and calendar not full despite demand; inconsistent execution of plays

## Value Proposition
- **25% more selling time** without adding headcount
- **Greater reach, better conversations, same headcount** – work every corner of TAM, surface sales-ready prospects, keep calendar full
- Consolidate tech stack; replace existing SEP at no extra cost when on AI Agents + AI Dialer annual contract
- Migration from existing SEP; sequences and workflows brought into one platform

## Target Customers
Sales leaders and RevOps at B2B companies who want to scale prospecting without scaling headcount; teams on Outreach or SalesLoft considering consolidation; organizations wanting AI-native orchestration for both reps and AI agents.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Legacy SEPs (Outreach, SalesLoft) | RegieOne is AI-native with agents and reps in one workflow; built-in dialer, enrichment, signals; can replace SEP at no cost |
| Standalone dialers | Integrated with AI warm-up and prioritization; part of single platform |
| Point AI tools | Full SEP + agents + dialer in one; not bolt-on |

## Pricing Model
*Free with annual contract for AI Agents + AI Dialer.* Contact sales for packages. Professional services: onboarding, migration from existing SEP, training and best practices.

## Additional Notes
- Task execution: complete SEP for multi-channel execution; reps and AI agents execute in a single workflow; AI assistance for rep-led outreach to top-tier leads
- Data: 220+ million contacts (verified mobile), 100+ built-in signals; unlimited custom signals; integration to Outreach or SalesLoft when not fully on RegieOne
