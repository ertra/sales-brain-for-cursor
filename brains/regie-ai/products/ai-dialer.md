# AI Dialer

## Company
Regie.ai

## Overview
Regie’s AI Dialer is a built-in parallel dialer that warms up leads, prioritizes the hottest ones, surfaces real-time talking points, and automates follow-up so reps spend less time on process and more time talking to buyers. It is powered by leads warmed up by AI Agents and is sold as part of a package that includes Agents (AI Agents + AI Dialer). It can run inside RegieOne or alongside your existing SEP.

## Main Features
- **Parallel dialing** – Dial up to 9 contacts at once; 5x connects, 3–4 hours saved per rep daily, 10x more talk time
- **Lead warm-up** – Agents research, enrich, and warm leads using 150+ signals (who to contact, when, what message); reps get a prioritized list ready to dial
- **AI-generated scripts** on connect and **personalized voicemails** when no answer (custom synthetic voice in rep’s voice)
- **Virtual sales floor** – Reps dial together with live video and real-time collaboration; managers can listen in and coach live; AI call scoring
- **Automated follow-up** – Post-call notes, CRM sync, draft/send follow-up emails so reps stay in the zone
- **Signal-based prioritization** – 150+ signals continuously analyzed for next-best conversation
- **Data** – Waterfall enrichment across leading vendors (included); spam detection and bad number rotation for better connects
- **Single-line up to 9-line** parallel dialing; AI phone scripts; AI intro line; Sales floor; Live listen; AI call scoring; AI voicemail drops; real-time call transcription

## Problem Solved
- Low connect rates and reps wasting time on manual dialing and voicemail
- No prioritization of who to call when; cold calling without warm-up or context
- Disconnected dialer from sequencing and enrichment; admin work after every call
- Remote teams missing the energy and coaching of a live sales floor

## Value Proposition
- **5x connects, 3–4 hours saved per rep daily, 10x more talk time, 0 admin work** (from site claims)
- Get to quality phone conversations faster with agent-warmed leads and real-time talking points
- One workflow from list to dial to CRM; no lifting a finger for notes and follow-up
- Sales floor energy and coaching in a remote setup

## Target Customers
SDR and inside sales teams that need higher call volume and connect rates without adding headcount; managers who want live listen and AI call scoring; organizations already using or considering Regie’s AI Agents.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Standalone dialers | Integrated with AI lead warm-up and prioritization; part of Regie’s agent workflow |
| Legacy SEP dialers | Parallel dialing (up to 9 lines), AI scripts/voicemail, virtual sales floor, AI scoring |
| Manual dialing | Agent-driven warm-up and prioritization; automated notes and follow-up |

## Pricing Model
Only available as part of a package that includes AI Agents. **AI Agents + AI Dialer** starting at $35K. Not sold as dialer-only. Contact sales.

## Additional Notes
- “The AI Dialer is powered by leads warmed up by Agents so can only be purchased as part of a package that includes Agents.” (Regie pricing FAQ)
- With RegieOne, dialer is in the same workflow as email, social, enrichment, and signals
- Testimonial (Jason Seeba, CMO): “We were able to increase call volumes without sacrificing quality — thanks to the AI Agents warming up and prioritizing the leads we dial. The real magic though was human and machine.”
