# Prospecting Agents

## Company
Regie.ai

## Overview
Regie’s AI Prospecting Agents augment your existing tech stack with AI-powered outreach so your entire TAM gets worked. They handle contact acquisition and enrichment, signal-based lead prioritization, multi-channel outreach, adaptive engagement, and rep follow-up task generation—with integration to Outreach or SalesLoft so you can keep your current SEP while adding agent capacity.

## Main Features
- **Contact acquisition & enrichment** – Find and enrich ICP contacts; pull from multiple data sources; keep records fresh
- **Signal-based lead prioritization** – 100+ built-in signals (Google, web, LinkedIn, 10-K, G2, Crunchbase, BuiltWith, company news, call transcripts, CRM); unlimited custom signals; intelligent actions from triggers
- **Multi-channel outreach support** – Email, social, and other channels orchestrated by agents
- **Adaptive engagement** – Timing and messaging adapt to engagement, persona, and intent
- **Rep follow-up task generation** – Agents create call tasks and handoffs when leads are ready for human touch
- **IP address safeguarding** – Compliance and safety for outbound
- **Integration** to current Sales Engagement Platform (Outreach or SalesLoft)

## Problem Solved
- TAM not fully worked; reps can’t research, enrich, and personalize at scale
- Manual list-building, stale data, and disconnected tools
- Inconsistent or generic outreach; missed intent signals and wrong timing
- Reps spending half their day on research and admin instead of selling

## Value Proposition
- Ensure your entire TAM gets targeted, signal-driven outreach without adding headcount
- Clean, enriched data and prioritization so reps focus on best-fit, sales-ready leads
- Works with existing SEP (Outreach/SalesLoft)—no full rip-and-replace required to start
- Foundation for adding AI Dialer or moving to RegieOne later

## Target Customers
SDR teams and RevOps already on Outreach or SalesLoft who want AI to scale research, enrichment, and personalized outreach without replacing their SEP first.

## Competition
| Competitor | Key Difference |
|------------|----------------|
| Standalone AI SDR tools | Regie integrates with Outreach/SalesLoft; part of a path to full AI SEP (RegieOne) |
| In-platform automation only | Dedicated AI agents that do research, enrichment, and outreach; not just templates |

## Pricing Model
Starting at $35K. Contact sales. Can be combined with AI Dialer (same starting point); RegieOne included free with annual contract for AI Agents + AI Dialer.

## Additional Notes
- Agents are "doers" not just assistants: they research, enrich, write/send emails, monitor signals, generate call tasks, drop voicemails, update CRM
- With RegieOne, agents and reps execute in a single workflow; with AI Agents-only package, agents feed your existing SEP
