# Sales Leader - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from sales leaders evaluating Regie.ai for outbound pipeline growth and execution efficiency.

## Objection Plays
### 1. Price/Budget: "We already pay for SEP tools"
- **Why They Say This**: Existing spend and concern about overlap.
- **Acknowledge**: "Makes sense to protect current spend and avoid duplication."
- **Respond**: "Regie.ai is positioned as a consolidation and productivity play, not just another point tool."
- **Proof Point**: To be verified.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which tools are non-negotiable today, and where is the biggest workflow friction?"

### 2. Timing: "Not the right quarter"
- **Why They Say This**: Competing initiatives and rollout fatigue.
- **Acknowledge**: "Timing matters when teams are balancing multiple priorities."
- **Respond**: "A focused pilot can validate value quickly without full-scale change."
- **Proof Point**: To be verified.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What outcome would make this a clear priority in the next 60-90 days?"

### 3. Competition: "We can do this with Outreach/Salesloft"
- **Why They Say This**: Comfort with incumbent workflow.
- **Acknowledge**: "Both are strong incumbents and common benchmarks."
- **Respond**: "Regie.ai differentiates on AI-native agent + rep orchestration and consolidation."
- **Proof Point**: To be verified.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What manual work still remains in your current flow despite your existing stack?"

## Operator Guidance
### Questions to Ask Early
1. Which pipeline KPI is most under pressure?
2. Where is your current outbound process still manual?
3. What would justify a workflow change this quarter?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No measurable KPI target for outbound improvements
- No stakeholder available to own pilot outcome

### Talk Tracks
- 15s: Regie.ai helps teams modernize outbound with AI-native workflows.
- 30s: Consolidate fragmented tools and reduce manual prospecting to increase pipeline velocity.
- 2min: Use a controlled pilot to validate productivity and quality gains before broader rollout.

### Next-Step CTA
- Align pilot scope, metrics, and decision timeline.
