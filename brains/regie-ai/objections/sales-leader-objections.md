# Sales Leader - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from sales leaders evaluating Regie.ai for outbound pipeline growth and execution efficiency.

## Objection Plays
### 1. Price/Budget: "We already pay for SEP tools"
- **Why They Say This**: Existing spend and concern about overlap.
- **Acknowledge**: "Makes sense to protect current spend and avoid duplication."
- **Respond**: "Regie.ai is positioned as a consolidation and productivity play, not just another point tool."
- **Proof Point**: To be verified.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which tools are non-negotiable today, and where is the biggest workflow friction?"

### 2. Timing: "Not the right quarter"
- **Why They Say This**: Competing initiatives and rollout fatigue.
- **Acknowledge**: "Timing matters when teams are balancing multiple priorities."
- **Respond**: "A focused pilot can validate value quickly without full-scale change."
- **Proof Point**: To be verified.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What outcome would make this a clear priority in the next 60-90 days?"

### 3. Competition: "We can do this with Outreach/Salesloft"
- **Why They Say This**: Comfort with incumbent workflow.
- **Acknowledge**: "Both are strong incumbents and common benchmarks."
- **Respond**: "Regie.ai differentiates on AI-native agent + rep orchestration and consolidation."
- **Proof Point**: To be verified.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What manual work still remains in your current flow despite your existing stack?"
