# Target Companies

## Overview
Regie.ai sells to B2B organizations that run outbound prospecting and want to scale pipeline without proportionally scaling headcount. Target customers range from mid-market sales teams to enterprise GTM organizations. They are often already using a Sales Engagement Platform (Outreach or SalesLoft) and/or a dialer, and are looking for AI to automate research, enrichment, personalization, and dialing—or to consolidate into a single AI-native SEP. Key segments include SaaS, enterprise software, data/tech, and security; roles span SDRs, AEs, Sales Leaders, RevOps, and Marketing.
