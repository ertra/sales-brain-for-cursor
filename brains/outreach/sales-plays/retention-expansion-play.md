# Sales Play: Retention & Expansion Execution

## Play Overview
| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Retention & Expansion Execution |
| **Target Persona** | Customer Success Manager |
| **Target Company** | Recurring-revenue B2B teams with churn/expansion pressure |
| **Products** | Amplify, Forecast, Meet |
| **Trigger Event** | Rising renewal risk or underperforming expansion pipeline |
| **Play Type** | Expansion |

## Entry Criteria
- **Trigger Events**: Renewal slippage; churn increase; expansion misses.
- **Ideal Signals**: Fragmented sales-to-CS handoff, reactive risk management, weak account orchestration.
- **Qualification Criteria**: CS owner, retention KPI baseline, cross-functional account process.
- **Disqualify If**: No CS KPI ownership; no alignment with sales on account workflows.

## Execution Sequence
1. **Research & Prep**: Review renewal calendar, churn segments, expansion attainment trends.
2. **Initial Outreach**: Lead with early-risk visibility and coordinated account-action framing.
3. **Follow-Up Sequence**: Share Workato expansion proof and lifecycle orchestration outcomes.
4. **Discovery**: Identify missed early signals and handoff breakdown points.
5. **Demo/Proposal**: Show account orchestration workflow and pilot one renewal cohort.

## Messaging Assets
- **15s Talk Track**: "Outreach helps CS teams move from reactive renewals to proactive retention and expansion workflows."
- **30s Talk Track**: "If risk appears too late, Outreach connects account signals and next actions so teams intervene earlier and grow smarter."
- **2min Talk Track**: "Retention performance often breaks because context and accountability are fragmented across teams. Outreach helps teams coordinate around shared account signals and structured workflows, improving early intervention and expansion execution. Start with one cohort and prove impact before scaling."
- **Primary CTA**: "Run a renewal-risk retrospective and launch one cohort pilot."

## Objection Handling
| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "This is mostly a sales platform." | Evaluate by renewal and expansion outcomes in one CS-led pilot cohort. |
| "CS budget is limited." | Tie spend to churn-risk reduction and expansion opportunity economics. |
| "Not during renewal season." | Start with one tier where process change is low-risk and high-learning. |
