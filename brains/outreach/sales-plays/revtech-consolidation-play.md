# Sales Play: RevTech Consolidation

## Play Overview
| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | RevTech Consolidation |
| **Target Persona** | Revenue Operations, Sales Leader |
| **Target Company** | Mid-market/enterprise teams with tool sprawl |
| **Products** | Engage, Deal, Forecast, Meet, Amplify |
| **Trigger Event** | Cost and complexity from disconnected GTM stack |
| **Play Type** | Competitive / Expansion |

## Entry Criteria
- **Trigger Events**: Stack rationalization initiative; budget pressure; post-merger process complexity.
- **Ideal Signals**: Multiple point tools across engagement, forecasting, and conversation workflows.
- **Qualification Criteria**: Executive sponsor for consolidation, RevOps owner, clear target-state criteria.
- **Disqualify If**: No consolidation mandate; no change capacity for platform-level rollout.

## Execution Sequence
1. **Research & Prep**: Map current toolset by workflow and total friction points.
2. **Initial Outreach**: Position around operational simplicity and workflow continuity.
3. **Follow-Up Sequence**: Share consolidation-oriented resources and migration framing.
4. **Discovery**: Quantify reconciliation effort, duplicate processes, and reporting lag.
5. **Demo/Proposal**: Present phased consolidation roadmap tied to KPI and risk controls.

## Messaging Assets
- **15s Talk Track**: "Outreach helps revenue teams replace workflow fragmentation with one execution platform."
- **30s Talk Track**: "If your stack is slowing execution, we can consolidate key motions into a phased rollout without forcing all-at-once change."
- **2min Talk Track**: "Tool sprawl creates hidden cost in handoff friction, reporting lag, and low adoption. Outreach packages core revenue workflows so teams can execute in one operating model, with phased migration and KPI guardrails. The goal is cleaner operations and measurable performance lift, not just vendor reduction."
- **Primary CTA**: "Run a workflow-and-tool consolidation assessment and define phase-one scope."

## Objection Handling
| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "We can't migrate right now." | Start with one high-friction workflow and preserve critical integrations during phase one. |
| "This could increase risk." | Use staged rollout with explicit success and rollback criteria. |
| "Our current tools are fine." | Quantify hidden operational cost and conversion drag from fragmentation. |
