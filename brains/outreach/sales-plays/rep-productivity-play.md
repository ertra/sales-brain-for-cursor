# Sales Play: Rep Productivity Without Headcount

## Play Overview
| | |
|--|--|
| **Play Name** | Rep Productivity Without Headcount |
| **Target Persona** | Sales Development, Sales Manager |
| **Target Company** | Outbound-heavy B2B teams with capacity constraints |
| **Products** | Engage, Amplify, Meet |
| **Trigger Event** | Pipeline goals rising while hiring remains flat |
| **Play Type** | Outbound / Inbound |

## Entry Criteria
- **Trigger Events**: Hiring freeze; productivity mandate; SDR conversion decline.
- **Ideal Signals**: High rep admin burden; inconsistent sequence execution; reply-rate pressure.
- **Qualification Criteria**: Existing outbound motion, measurable funnel KPIs, manager sponsor.
- **Disqualify If**: No outbound KPIs; no process owner for sequence quality.

## Execution Sequence
1. **Research & Prep**: Gather current activity-to-meeting and meeting-to-opportunity baselines.
2. **Initial Outreach**: Lead with productivity + conversion proof, not feature list.
3. **Follow-Up Sequence**: Share BrightTALK/Renaissance-style conversion outcomes.
4. **Discovery**: Identify top rep time drains and conversion drop-off stages.
5. **Demo/Proposal**: Show sequence + AI assist workflow and propose segment pilot.

## Messaging Assets
- **15s Talk Track**: "Outreach helps your team convert more pipeline without adding proportional headcount."
- **30s Talk Track**: "When reps are overloaded, we combine structured engagement and AI-assisted workflows to improve both output and quality."
- **2min Talk Track**: "Most teams do not have an effort problem; they have an execution consistency problem. Outreach helps standardize sequence quality, reduce manual overhead, and give managers better insight into what drives conversion. The result is stronger productivity and better funnel efficiency at current team size."
- **Primary CTA**: "Run a 30-day productivity pilot on one outbound segment."

## Objection Handling
| Common Objection | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| "AI outreach will sound generic." | Use AI as assistive drafting with rep QA controls and message standards. |
| "We should just hire more reps." | Compare cost per qualified opportunity from process lift vs incremental headcount. |
| "We can't retrain now." | Start with one segment and one playbook for minimal change load. |
