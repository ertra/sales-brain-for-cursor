# Sales Manager - Objection Handling

## Overview
Manager objections typically center on rep adoption, coaching overhead, and fear that new tools become extra admin.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Adoption: "My reps won't use this consistently"
- **Why They Say This**: Prior rollout fatigue and uneven rep behavior.
- **Acknowledge**: "Adoption consistency is a real manager concern."
- **Respond**: "We'll anchor rollout to your weekly coaching cadence so usage is tied to existing manager routines."
- **Proof Point**: Meet/Deal packages are designed around call, deal, and action workflows managers already run.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What manager routine is best to attach first-use behavior to?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "I can't justify this for my team"
- **Why They Say This**: Budget control sits above manager level.
- **Acknowledge**: "Totally fair - managers need a clear internal case."
- **Respond**: "Let's build a manager-level business case tied to pipeline quality and coaching coverage."
- **Proof Point**: Package model allows role-specific deployment; customer stories cite conversion and productivity improvements.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which team KPI would your leader expect to improve first?"

### 3. Timing: "We're in peak quarter mode"
- **Why They Say This**: Team cannot absorb heavy change in critical periods.
- **Acknowledge**: "Peak quarter is not the time for broad disruption."
- **Respond**: "Start with one manager pod and one use case so execution is protected."
- **Proof Point**: Modular package rollout supports phased activation.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Would a single-pod pilot after forecast call week be realistic?"

## Operator Guidance
### Questions to Ask Early
1. What coaching motions are currently hardest to scale?
2. How is pipeline risk prioritized in weekly manager reviews?
3. Which rep behaviors need most consistency?
4. What KPI can manager pilots influence quickly?

### Disqualification Criteria
- Manager has no control over team process.
- No measurable manager-level KPI baseline.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: This is a manager enablement rollout, not just a tool rollout.
- **30s**: We tie usage to your existing coaching and inspection cadence to avoid extra admin.
- **2min**: Managers usually reject tools that add process burden. By anchoring rollout to existing routines and one measurable KPI, this becomes a coaching and intervention accelerator rather than another dashboard.

### Next-Step CTA
- Define one manager pod pilot with coaching and pipeline-risk KPIs.

## Quick Reference
| Objection Type | Key Response | Proof Point |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Rep adoption | Attach rollout to manager cadence | Role-specific package workflows |
| Budget | Build KPI case at manager level | Conversion/productivity story evidence |
| Timing | Start with one pod, one workflow | Modular rollout |
| Status quo | Improve existing routine, not replace it overnight | Pilot-first approach |
