# Sales Manager - Objection Handling

## Overview
Manager objections typically center on rep adoption, coaching overhead, and fear that new tools become extra admin.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Adoption: "My reps won't use this consistently"
- **Why They Say This**: Prior rollout fatigue and uneven rep behavior.
- **Acknowledge**: "Adoption consistency is a real manager concern."
- **Respond**: "We'll anchor rollout to your weekly coaching cadence so usage is tied to existing manager routines."
- **Proof Point**: Meet/Deal packages are designed around call, deal, and action workflows managers already run.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What manager routine is best to attach first-use behavior to?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "I can't justify this for my team"
- **Why They Say This**: Budget control sits above manager level.
- **Acknowledge**: "Totally fair - managers need a clear internal case."
- **Respond**: "Let's build a manager-level business case tied to pipeline quality and coaching coverage."
- **Proof Point**: Package model allows role-specific deployment; customer stories cite conversion and productivity improvements.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which team KPI would your leader expect to improve first?"

### 3. Timing: "We're in peak quarter mode"
- **Why They Say This**: Team cannot absorb heavy change in critical periods.
- **Acknowledge**: "Peak quarter is not the time for broad disruption."
- **Respond**: "Start with one manager pod and one use case so execution is protected."
- **Proof Point**: Modular package rollout supports phased activation.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Would a single-pod pilot after forecast call week be realistic?"
