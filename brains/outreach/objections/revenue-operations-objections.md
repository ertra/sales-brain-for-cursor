# Revenue Operations - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common RevOps objections around implementation complexity, integration reliability, and process governance.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Integration: "This won't fit our current stack"
- **Why They Say This**: Previous integration projects created data quality issues.
- **Acknowledge**: "Integration risk is usually the biggest concern for RevOps."
- **Respond**: "Let's map required data flows first and phase deployment by workflow so governance stays controlled."
- **Proof Point**: Outreach platform emphasizes integrations and governance capabilities.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which integration failure would be unacceptable for your team?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "We already spend too much on RevTech"
- **Why They Say This**: Tool sprawl and cost fatigue.
- **Acknowledge**: "Totally fair - consolidation pressure is real."
- **Respond**: "This should be evaluated as a consolidation and efficiency play, not just net-new spend."
- **Proof Point**: Pricing: per-user model, no platform fees, package-based deployment.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which tools could be reduced if this workflow replaced them?"

### 3. Timing: "We have too many systems projects right now"
- **Why They Say This**: RevOps capacity is constrained.
- **Acknowledge**: "Capacity is usually the real blocker."
- **Respond**: "A limited rollout on one motion can reduce project load and still produce measurable operational lift."
- **Proof Point**: Modular packages and services options on pricing FAQ.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What is the smallest workflow we could pilot without overloading your team?"

## Evidence & Sources
- **Claim**: Outreach pricing FAQ describes package customization, professional services options, and per-user pricing with no platform fees. | **Source**: Outreach pricing (`https://www.outreach.io/pricing`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20
- **Claim**: Outreach platform messaging highlights governance and integrations as part of trust architecture. | **Source**: Outreach platform (`https://www.outreach.io/platform`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20


## Quick Reference
| Objection Type | Key Response | Proof Point |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Integration risk | Map dependencies + phased rollout | Platform integrations/governance messaging |
| Budget/tool sprawl | Treat as consolidation and efficiency case | No platform fee + package model |
| Capacity/timing | Start with smallest high-impact workflow | Services + modular rollout |
| Competition | Evaluate by operational fit and adoption burden | Competitor scorecard |
