# Customer Success Manager - Objection Handling

## Overview
CSM objections often focus on whether the platform is too sales-centric and whether it will actually help retention and expansion.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Fit: "This seems built for sales, not customer success"
- **Why They Say This**: Prior tools ignored post-sales workflows.
- **Acknowledge**: "That's a common concern in CS evaluations."
- **Respond**: "We should evaluate on renewal-risk visibility and account continuity outcomes, not sales labels."
- **Proof Point**: Outreach messaging includes retention and expansion workflows with early risk flags.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What post-sales workflow gap hurts your renewals most today?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "CS budget is already tight"
- **Why They Say This**: CS teams compete for funding with sales priorities.
- **Acknowledge**: "Budget allocation across GTM is always a balancing act."
- **Respond**: "Let's tie this to churn-risk reduction and expansion opportunity capture."
- **Proof Point**: Customer listing notes +68% expansion opportunities in Workato story headline.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which retention or expansion metric can justify spend fastest?"

### 3. Timing: "We'll revisit after renewal season"
- **Why They Say This**: Team cannot absorb change during critical periods.
- **Acknowledge**: "Totally fair during a high-stakes renewal window."
- **Respond**: "Start with one account segment and early-risk use case to support, not disrupt, current process."
- **Proof Point**: Modular workflow rollout approach across packages.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which account tier could support a low-risk pilot?"
