# Sales Development - Objection Handling

## Overview
SDR/BDR objections are usually about workflow speed, personalization quality, and concern that AI hurts message authenticity.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Quality: "AI outreach will sound generic"
- **Why They Say This**: Fear that automation lowers response quality.
- **Acknowledge**: "Quality control is a valid concern."
- **Respond**: "Use AI as drafting/prioritization support with rep review guardrails, not blind autopilot."
- **Proof Point**: Amplify positioning emphasizes AI personalization and engagement workflows.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What message-quality standards would your team require?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "We should hire more SDRs instead"
- **Why They Say This**: Headcount feels like a more direct path to pipeline.
- **Acknowledge**: "More capacity is always appealing."
- **Respond**: "Let's compare cost per qualified opportunity from process improvement vs net-new headcount."
- **Proof Point**: Customer listing includes +25% meetings and +66% positive reply gains.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Would conversion lift at current headcount change your hiring plan?"

### 3. Timing: "We can't retrain SDRs right now"
- **Why They Say This**: Team cadence is already full.
- **Acknowledge**: "Training overhead can kill momentum if it's too broad."
- **Respond**: "Run one segment pilot with one playbook to minimize retraining load."
- **Proof Point**: Engage package supports structured sequences and template governance.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which segment is best for a focused pilot?"

## Evidence & Sources
- **Claim**: Engage includes sequences/templates/automation, and Amplify includes AI personalization/engagement capabilities. | **Source**: Outreach pricing (`https://www.outreach.io/pricing`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20
- **Claim**: Customer stories listing includes +25% meetings booked and +66% positive email reply improvements. | **Source**: Outreach customers (`https://www.outreach.io/customers`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20

## Operator Guidance
### Questions to Ask Early
1. Where does your outbound funnel underperform most?
2. How do you currently enforce message-quality standards?
3. What is current cost per qualified opportunity?
4. Which SDR segment is easiest to pilot safely?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No outbound KPI baseline.
- Team rejects any workflow standardization or QA process.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: AI is an assistive lever for quality and speed, not a replacement for rep judgment.
- **30s**: We can prove conversion lift with one segment pilot and strict quality guardrails.
- **2min**: SDR objections are usually quality and change-management concerns. A controlled pilot with defined QA standards and measurable funnel goals makes adoption evidence-driven and low risk.

### Next-Step CTA
- Launch one 30-day SDR pilot with conversion and quality scorecards.
