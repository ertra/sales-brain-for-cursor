# Sales Development - Objection Handling

## Overview
SDR/BDR objections are usually about workflow speed, personalization quality, and concern that AI hurts message authenticity.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Quality: "AI outreach will sound generic"
- **Why They Say This**: Fear that automation lowers response quality.
- **Acknowledge**: "Quality control is a valid concern."
- **Respond**: "Use AI as drafting/prioritization support with rep review guardrails, not blind autopilot."
- **Proof Point**: Amplify positioning emphasizes AI personalization and engagement workflows.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What message-quality standards would your team require?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "We should hire more SDRs instead"
- **Why They Say This**: Headcount feels like a more direct path to pipeline.
- **Acknowledge**: "More capacity is always appealing."
- **Respond**: "Let's compare cost per qualified opportunity from process improvement vs net-new headcount."
- **Proof Point**: Customer listing includes +25% meetings and +66% positive reply gains.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Would conversion lift at current headcount change your hiring plan?"

### 3. Timing: "We can't retrain SDRs right now"
- **Why They Say This**: Team cadence is already full.
- **Acknowledge**: "Training overhead can kill momentum if it's too broad."
- **Respond**: "Run one segment pilot with one playbook to minimize retraining load."
- **Proof Point**: Engage package supports structured sequences and template governance.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which segment is best for a focused pilot?"
