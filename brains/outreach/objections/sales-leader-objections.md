# Sales Leader - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from sales leaders and responses focused on forecast confidence, productivity lift, and predictable execution.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Risk/Change: "I don't want to disrupt my team mid-quarter"
- **Why They Say This**: Fear of productivity dip during rollout.
- **Acknowledge**: "Protecting in-quarter execution is critical."
- **Respond**: "We can phase by one motion and one manager cohort to avoid broad disruption."
- **Proof Point**: Outreach supports package-based rollout by workflow.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which workflow can we improve with lowest in-quarter risk first?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "This seems expensive right now"
- **Why They Say This**: Budget is tied to near-term commitments.
- **Acknowledge**: "Understood, especially with quarterly pressure."
- **Respond**: "Let's tie cost to one measurable outcome like forecast variance reduction or rep productivity gain."
- **Proof Point**: Customer listings include +15% reps hitting quota and productivity claims.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What KPI outcome would make this investment acceptable?"

### 3. Timing: "Let's revisit after this quarter"
- **Why They Say This**: Competing priorities and limited management bandwidth.
- **Acknowledge**: "That timing concern is valid."
- **Respond**: "A small pilot now can reduce risk and give you evidence before next planning cycle."
- **Proof Point**: Modular packages and customer references with measurable outcomes.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Would a scoped 60-day pilot help de-risk next quarter decisions?"
