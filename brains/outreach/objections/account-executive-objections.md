# Account Executive - Objection Handling

## Overview
AE objections are usually practical: extra clicks, workflow interruption, and concern that automation harms personalization.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Workflow burden: "This will create more admin for me"
- **Why They Say This**: Prior tools increased data-entry work.
- **Acknowledge**: "No rep wants another admin tool."
- **Respond**: "We'll focus on automation that removes post-call and follow-up burden first."
- **Proof Point**: Meet/Call include automated summary/action-item support; Deal provides activity context.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which admin task would you most want eliminated first?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "I'd rather spend on more pipeline"
- **Why They Say This**: Reps value direct pipeline generation spend.
- **Acknowledge**: "Makes sense to prioritize pipeline impact."
- **Respond**: "This should be judged by conversion and cycle-time improvements from your existing pipeline."
- **Proof Point**: Customer listings show meeting-to-opportunity and qualified opportunity gains.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Would faster conversion on existing pipeline be as valuable as more top-funnel volume?"

### 3. Timing: "I can't change my process mid-deal cycle"
- **Why They Say This**: Fear of disrupting active opportunities.
- **Acknowledge**: "Protecting active deals is the right priority."
- **Respond**: "We'll apply changes to a controlled segment first, not every open opportunity."
- **Proof Point**: Modular deployment by package/use case.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which segment is safest for a controlled pilot?"

## Quick Reference
| Objection Type | Key Response | Proof Point |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| More admin | Prioritize automation-first rollout | AI summaries and action items |
| Budget priority | Tie to conversion and cycle-time | +93% / +92% listed outcomes |
| Timing | Segment-limited pilot | Package-based phased rollout |
| Personalization concerns | Keep rep control, use AI as assistive layer | AI-assisted, not fully autonomous workflow |
