# Common - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections across Outreach buying committees and practical responses tied to pricing FAQs, platform outcomes, and customer-story proof.

## Objection Plays

### 1. Competition: "We're also evaluating Salesloft/Clari/Gong"
- **Why They Say This**: They want category confidence and leverage in negotiation.
- **Acknowledge**: "Makes sense to compare serious options."
- **Respond**: "The best decision comes from mapping your top 2-3 KPI gaps and testing which platform improves them fastest with your team structure."
- **Proof Point**: Outreach platform and customer-story metrics across pipeline, forecasting, and productivity use cases.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "Which outcome matters most in 90 days: conversion, forecast confidence, or productivity?"

### 2. Price/Budget: "We don't have the budget"
- **Why They Say This**: Budget is constrained or value is not yet concrete.
- **Acknowledge**: "Budget pressure is real right now."
- **Respond**: "Let's frame this as cost of inaction and measurable return by workflow. We can scope a pilot tied to one KPI before broader rollout."
- **Proof Point**: Pricing FAQ says per-user pricing, no platform fees, support included with Engage; customer stories list measurable gains.
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What KPI improvement would justify budget this quarter?"

### 3. Timing: "Not the right time"
- **Why They Say This**: Priorities are crowded or internal ownership is unclear.
- **Acknowledge**: "Timing is important, especially with change initiatives."
- **Respond**: "We can start with a narrow motion and prove value quickly instead of running a full transformation all at once."
- **Proof Point**: Outreach package model supports phased adoption (Engage, Deal, Forecast, etc.).
- **Follow-Up Question**: "What would need to happen for this to become a priority in the next 60-90 days?"
