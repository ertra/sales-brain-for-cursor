# Outreach Deal

## Overview
Outreach Deal is the package focused on deal management and pipeline execution. It aims to provide unified deal visibility, identify risk earlier, and help teams move opportunities forward with clearer context.

## Problem and Outcome
- **Primary Problem**: Deal progress and risk signals are often fragmented, slowing action and reducing close predictability.

- **Who Benefits Most**: Account executives, sales managers, and revenue operations leaders.

## Core Capabilities
- AI-powered smart deal assist.
- Deal health scoring.
- Deal grid and overview with activity history.

## Value Proposition
Deal helps teams execute opportunities with clearer risk visibility and structured deal workflows so they can improve velocity and close confidence.

## ICP Fit and Disqualifiers
- **Best Fit**: Teams with complex pipelines that need stronger deal inspection and manager visibility.
- **Disqualify If**:
  - Deal cycle is very transactional with minimal need for structured deal governance.
  - No agreed definition of deal stages or risk criteria.
  - Team unwilling to operationalize deal health review cadence.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Where do deals most often stall, and how early can your team identify that risk?
2. How do managers currently inspect deal quality beyond CRM stage fields?
3. What does your current deal review cadence miss that impacts forecast confidence?

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Deal gives sellers and managers a unified, AI-assisted view of opportunity health and progression.
- **30s**: If deals are slipping due to late risk detection, Deal improves visibility and actionability so teams can intervene earlier and keep pipeline moving.
- **2min**: Many teams have activity data but lack an operational deal execution layer that translates signals into action. Deal combines health scoring, unified activity context, and structured inspection workflows to surface risk earlier and prioritize what to do next. This supports both rep execution and manager coaching, especially in multi-stakeholder opportunities. We can validate this by analyzing your stall points, review process, and win/loss patterns.

### Next-Step CTA
- Run a recent-loss and slipped-deal analysis to identify top risk patterns.
- Set up a pilot inspection cadence with standardized deal health criteria.
