# Outreach Amplify

## Overview
Outreach Amplify is the AI agent package designed to power revenue use cases through a credit-based, per-action model. It is positioned as a way to scale AI-driven personalization, research, deal support, and conversation workflows.

## Problem and Outcome
- **Primary Problem**: Teams struggle to scale high-quality revenue execution without adding proportional headcount.
- **Business Outcome**: Higher seller productivity and broader workflow automation across pipeline, deals, and account actions.
- **Who Benefits Most**: Sales development, account executives, revenue operations, and customer-facing revenue teams.

## Core Capabilities
- AI Revenue Agent (including enrichment/targeting and AI personalization/engagement).
- AI Deal Agent.
- AI Research Agent.
- AI Conversation Agent (coming soon, per pricing page).

## Value Proposition
Amplify gives teams a scalable AI execution layer to automate repetitive revenue tasks and increase precision across prospecting, deal execution, and customer lifecycle motions.

## ICP Fit and Disqualifiers
- **Best Fit**: Teams with clear workflow bottlenecks and willingness to operationalize AI-assisted process changes.
- **Disqualify If**:
  - Organization lacks process discipline and KPI ownership for AI workflow rollout.
  - Team is not ready to adopt consumption-based AI operating models.
  - Regulatory/internal policy constraints block core AI use cases.
