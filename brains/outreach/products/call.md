# Outreach Call (Voice Package)

## Overview
Outreach Call is the voice package for outbound motions, with usage-based calling plans and phone numbers. It adds integrated dialing and call workflow support to the broader Outreach execution platform.

## Problem and Outcome
- **Primary Problem**: Teams struggle to operationalize phone outreach with consistent call workflows and visibility.
- **Business Outcome**: Faster call execution and better call process consistency through integrated dialing and AI-supported summaries.
- **Who Benefits Most**: SDR/BDR teams, inside sales teams, and sales managers.

## Core Capabilities
- Integrated sales dialer.
- Live call monitoring.
- Custom call dispositions.
- AI-powered call summary and Q&A.

## Value Proposition
Call operationalizes phone-based outreach as part of one revenue workflow, reducing friction between call activity and the rest of the sales execution process.

## ICP Fit and Disqualifiers
- **Best Fit**: Teams with active outbound call motions and manager-led call quality oversight.
- **Disqualify If**:
  - Organization does not run outbound calling.
  - Existing telephony stack is contractually fixed with no near-term flexibility.
  - Team lacks process ownership for call coaching and disposition hygiene.

## Competitive Positioning
| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Advantage | Landmine Question |

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. What percentage of outbound execution relies on calls versus email/social today?
2. How do managers currently monitor call quality and coaching consistency?
3. Where do reps lose time between dialing activity and post-call follow-up?

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Call gives your team an integrated dialer and AI-supported call workflows inside Outreach.
- **30s**: Instead of treating calls as a disconnected tool, Call brings dialing, monitoring, and post-call intelligence into the same workflow reps use for revenue execution.
- **2min**: Phone outreach often breaks process consistency because dialing, dispositioning, and follow-up live in different systems. Call packages this motion into Outreach with integrated dialing and AI-assisted post-call support. That helps teams run cleaner call operations, improve manager visibility, and shorten the gap between conversation and next action. We should test this against your current call throughput, coaching process, and CRM hygiene.

### Next-Step CTA
- Map current telephony workflow and identify call-to-next-step delays.
- Design a pilot with a call-heavy segment and manager coaching scorecard.
