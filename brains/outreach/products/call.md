# Outreach Call (Voice Package)

## Overview
Outreach Call is the voice package for outbound motions, with usage-based calling plans and phone numbers. It adds integrated dialing and call workflow support to the broader Outreach execution platform.

## Problem and Outcome
- **Primary Problem**: Teams struggle to operationalize phone outreach with consistent call workflows and visibility.
- **Business Outcome**: Faster call execution and better call process consistency through integrated dialing and AI-supported summaries.
- **Who Benefits Most**: SDR/BDR teams, inside sales teams, and sales managers.

## Core Capabilities
- Integrated sales dialer.
- Live call monitoring.
- Custom call dispositions.
- AI-powered call summary and Q&A.

## Value Proposition
Call operationalizes phone-based outreach as part of one revenue workflow, reducing friction between call activity and the rest of the sales execution process.

## ICP Fit and Disqualifiers
- **Best Fit**: Teams with active outbound call motions and manager-led call quality oversight.
- **Disqualify If**:
  - Organization does not run outbound calling.
  - Existing telephony stack is contractually fixed with no near-term flexibility.
  - Team lacks process ownership for call coaching and disposition hygiene.

## Competitive Positioning
| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Advantage | Landmine Question |
|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
