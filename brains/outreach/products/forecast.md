# Outreach Forecast

## Overview

- Scenario planning for different revenue outcomes.

## Value Proposition
Forecast provides a more systematic and defensible forecasting workflow so revenue leaders can plan with greater confidence and respond earlier to risk.

  - No formal forecast cadence or ownership.
