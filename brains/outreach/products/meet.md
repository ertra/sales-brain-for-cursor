# Outreach Meet

## Overview
Outreach Meet is the conversation intelligence package (including Kaia capabilities) for real-time call assistance, post-meeting insights, and coaching support. It helps revenue teams capture and activate conversation signals across the platform.

## Problem and Outcome
- **Primary Problem**: Conversation insights are often trapped in calls and not consistently turned into coaching or next steps.
- **Business Outcome**: Better call quality, stronger coaching consistency, and faster post-meeting execution.
- **Who Benefits Most**: Account executives, sales managers, enablement teams, and customer-facing teams.

## Core Capabilities
- Real-time call recording and transcription.
- AI-powered smart meeting assist.
- Automated summaries and action items.
- Search, playlists, and clips for coaching and reuse.

## Value Proposition
Meet turns live customer conversations into actionable workflow signals, helping teams improve execution quality and scale coaching without adding manager overhead.

## ICP Fit and Disqualifiers
- **Best Fit**: Teams running frequent discovery/demo calls with a need to improve rep quality and coaching scale.
- **Disqualify If**:
  - Very low call volume and no structured coaching process.
  - No team ownership for call review or quality standards.
  - Strict recording constraints that block conversation capture.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How consistently are post-call action items captured and executed today?
2. How much manager time is spent reviewing calls and preparing coaching?
3. Which rep behaviors in calls correlate most with win/loss outcomes?

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Meet captures call intelligence and turns it into immediate next actions and scalable coaching.
- **30s**: With Meet, reps get real-time and post-call AI support while managers gain reusable conversation insights for faster, more consistent coaching.
- **2min**: Teams often record calls but still miss execution because action items and coaching never become operational workflows. Meet packages conversation intelligence into Outreach with transcription, summaries, and reusable call artifacts. That reduces admin work, helps managers coach at scale, and improves consistency from discovery to close. We can validate fit by looking at your current review cadence, coaching bandwidth, and call-to-action conversion gaps.

### Next-Step CTA
- Audit current call review process and identify delays in action-item follow-through.
- Launch a pilot for one team with coaching and post-call SLA metrics.
