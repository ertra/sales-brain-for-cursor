# Outreach Engage

## Overview
Outreach Engage is the sales engagement package focused on orchestrating outreach activity and execution workflows. It is designed to help teams improve pipeline generation efficiency with templates, sequences, automations, and CRM sync in one workflow.

## Problem and Outcome
- **Primary Problem**: Sellers lose time and consistency when outreach workflows are fragmented across tools and manual steps.
- **Business Outcome**: More consistent outbound execution, improved seller productivity, and stronger top-of-funnel pipeline generation.
- **Who Benefits Most**: SDR/BDR teams, account executives, and frontline sales managers.

## Core Capabilities
- Sequences, snippets, and templates for repeatable outreach.
- Smart account planning and relationship mapping.
- Automations/triggers and CRM sync (including custom objects).

## Value Proposition
Engage provides a structured execution layer for outbound and account development so teams can run repeatable, higher-velocity prospecting motions while reducing manual effort.

## ICP Fit and Disqualifiers
- **Best Fit**: Revenue teams that run high-volume prospecting and need standardized outreach quality.
- **Disqualify If**:
  - Team has no outbound motion or no need for structured cadence execution.
  - Team cannot operationalize sequences or message governance.
  - No CRM baseline for sync-driven workflows.

## Competitive Positioning
