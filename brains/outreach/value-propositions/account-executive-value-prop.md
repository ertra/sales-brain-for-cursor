# Outreach Deal -> Account Executive Value Proposition

## Overview
For AEs, Outreach helps keep complex opportunities moving by combining deal health visibility, action-oriented workflows, and AI-assisted follow-through. It reduces non-selling admin and improves close consistency.

## Value Drivers

## Quantified Value
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|

## Evidence & Sources
- **Claim**: Deal package includes smart deal assist, deal health score, deal grid, and deal activity overview. | **Source**: Outreach pricing (`https://www.outreach.io/pricing`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Where do AEs lose momentum most often in the deal cycle?
2. How much AE time is consumed by post-call admin?
3. Which deal signals are missing when reps prioritize their week?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No complex opportunity motion requiring deal orchestration.
- No willingness to standardize AE process behavior.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps AEs keep deals moving with less admin and better risk visibility.
- **30s**: If opportunities stall from manual coordination, Outreach gives reps clearer health signals and workflow support to sustain momentum.
- **2min**: AEs frequently lose time to coordination work and late-stage surprises. Outreach positions a deal workflow where opportunity context, conversation follow-up, and next actions are connected. That helps reps spend more time on buyer-facing work and improves conversion consistency across the team.

### Next-Step CTA
- Baseline AE cycle-time and stage-conversion drop-off, then run a targeted pilot.

## Messaging Framework
- **Subject Lines**: Keep deals moving with less admin; Improve AE close consistency; Reduce deal slippage this quarter
- **Phrases That Resonate**: deal momentum, fewer stalled opportunities, next-best actions, cycle-time control
- **Phrases to Avoid**: process-heavy language without rep productivity benefit

## Competitive Positioning
| Alternative | Their Claim | Our Advantage |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| CRM-only execution | One source for opportunity tracking | Adds workflow actionability and risk guidance |
| Separate engagement + CI stack | Best-in-class point depth | Connected deal workflow and follow-through context |
| Do Nothing | Reps can self-manage | Persistent slippage and admin burden limit performance |
