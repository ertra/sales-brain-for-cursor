## Evidence & Sources
- **Claim**: Outreach messaging includes retain-and-expand AI orchestration with early renewal risk flagging. | **Source**: Outreach homepage (`https://www.outreach.io/`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How early is renewal risk surfaced for top-tier accounts?
2. What account context is commonly lost at handoff?
3. How are expansion plays triggered and measured today?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No CS ownership for retention/expansion outcomes.
- No cross-functional collaboration on account execution.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps CSMs move from reactive renewals to proactive account orchestration.
- **30s**: If your team catches churn risk too late, Outreach aligns account signals and actions so CSMs can intervene earlier and expand with better timing.
- **2min**: CS effectiveness is constrained when account context is fragmented and risk signals are delayed. Outreach positions a workflow where sales and post-sales signals are connected, enabling proactive renewal management and more disciplined expansion execution. This reduces reactive firefighting and improves account predictability.

### Next-Step CTA
- Review recent at-risk renewals and map missed early-warning signals.

## Messaging Framework
- **Subject Lines**: Catch renewal risk earlier; Improve CS account orchestration; Turn retention signals into action
- **Phrases That Resonate**: proactive renewal management, account continuity, retention confidence, expansion timing
- **Phrases to Avoid**: net-new logo language for renewal-centric stakeholders

## Competitive Positioning
| Alternative | Their Claim | Our Advantage |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| CSM manual process | Human-touch is sufficient | Adds earlier signal detection and structured workflows |
| Separate CS tools + sales tools | Specialized feature sets | Shared account context across teams |
| Do Nothing | Current retention process is acceptable | Late risk detection and inconsistent expansion persists |
