### Discovery Questions
1. How do you currently identify which deals and reps need intervention this week?
2. What percentage of your coaching time is reactive versus planned?
3. Where does your current pipeline review process break down?

### Disqualification Criteria
- Manager has no ownership of coaching or pipeline inspection.
- Team lacks a recurring process for pipeline and deal reviews.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps sales managers spot risk early and coach reps with clearer, actionable insight.
- **30s**: If your managers are overloaded, Outreach surfaces the right pipeline and rep signals so they can prioritize interventions that actually move outcomes.
- **2min**: Most managers know where outcomes are off but struggle to pinpoint why fast enough. Outreach gives managers a consolidated view of pipeline movement, deal risk, and rep behavior so coaching becomes timely and specific. Instead of spending cycles on admin and status collection, managers can focus on improving execution quality across the team. We can test fit by mapping your current review cadence, coaching effort, and conversion gaps.
