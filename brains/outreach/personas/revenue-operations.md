# Revenue Operations

## Overview
Revenue Operations leaders own process integrity, pipeline governance, and system-level revenue visibility. They buy when current tooling causes leakage, inefficiency, and unreliable forecasting.

## Role and Context
- **Role/Title**: VP/Director of RevOps, GTM Operations leader.
- **Core Responsibilities**: Pipeline governance, process design, reporting, system integration, forecasting support.
- **Typical Company Context**: Scaling or enterprise revenue organizations with multiple GTM systems.

## Pains, Drivers, and Priorities
- **Top Pain Points**:
  - Pipeline leakage and inconsistent stage hygiene.
  - Disjointed workflows across engagement, deal, and forecast processes.
  - High manual effort to reconcile data and prepare forecast views.
- **Business Priorities**:
  - Improve data/process consistency across teams.
  - Reduce operational complexity from tool sprawl.
  - Increase forecast confidence and reporting reliability.
- **Buying Triggers**:
  - Executive demand for more reliable forecasting.
  - Ongoing process breakdowns at pipeline stage transitions.
  - Strategic initiative to consolidate revenue tech stack.

## Buying Behavior
- **Decision Criteria**: Integration readiness, governance controls, workflow configurability, measurable process outcomes.
- **Stakeholders**: Sales leadership, IT/security, Finance, frontline managers.
- **Common Risks/Concerns**: Migration effort, data quality risk, implementation complexity.

## Messaging Guidance
- **What Resonates**: Pipeline integrity, workflow consistency, one platform, governance, predictable operations.
- **What to Avoid**: Vague AI claims without operational control and KPI proof.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Where does your pipeline leak most today, and how is that measured?
2. Which processes still require manual reconciliation across systems?
3. What does leadership need from RevOps that is currently hard to deliver?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No RevOps ownership or mandate for process/system change.
- No measurable operational baseline for pipeline or forecast outcomes.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps RevOps standardize revenue workflows and reduce leakage across the funnel.
- **30s**: If your team is stitching together disconnected systems, Outreach unifies execution and forecasting workflows so RevOps can improve reliability and speed.
- **2min**: RevOps teams often spend too much time reconciling data and not enough time improving process. Outreach provides one workflow platform spanning engagement, deal management, and forecasting, which reduces handoff friction and improves governance. The value shows up in better stage discipline, cleaner forecast prep, and faster issue detection. We can evaluate this against your leakage points, operational toil, and reporting cycle time.

### Next-Step CTA
- Map current funnel leakage by stage and identify top process breakdowns.
- Define a phased consolidation plan tied to RevOps success metrics.
