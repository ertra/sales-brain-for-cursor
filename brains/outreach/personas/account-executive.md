# Account Executive

## Overview
Account Executives own deal progression and close outcomes. They buy when they need to reduce manual effort, keep multi-stakeholder deals on track, and improve execution quality from discovery to close.

## Role and Context
- **Role/Title**: Account Executive (mid-market/enterprise/new business).
- **Core Responsibilities**: Opportunity progression, stakeholder alignment, business case creation, closing revenue.
- **Typical Company Context**: Teams with complex buying committees and multi-step sales cycles.

## Pains, Drivers, and Priorities
- **Top Pain Points**:
  - Deal slippage due to weak stakeholder alignment.
  - Heavy admin workload on updates, follow-ups, and call notes.
  - Difficulty maintaining momentum across long sales cycles.
- **Business Priorities**:
  - Increase deal velocity and close rates.
  - Keep buying committees aligned to shared plans.
  - Spend more time on selling, less on admin.
- **Buying Triggers**:
  - Quarter-over-quarter decline in close rates.
  - High volume of stalled opportunities.
  - Manager pressure for better deal execution discipline.

## Buying Behavior
- **Decision Criteria**: Daily usability, impact on win rate/velocity, actionability of deal insights.
- **Stakeholders**: Sales managers, RevOps, Solution Consultants, CS handoff owners.
- **Common Risks/Concerns**: Extra workflow burden, poor integration into existing rep routines.

## Messaging Guidance
- **What Resonates**: Deal momentum, stakeholder alignment, reduced admin, AI-assisted next best actions.
- **What to Avoid**: Top-down platform language without clear rep workflow benefit.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Where do your deals usually stall and why?
2. How do you currently keep internal and external stakeholders aligned?
3. How much selling time is lost weekly to manual updates and follow-up tasks?

### Disqualification Criteria
- AE workflow is entirely transactional with minimal need for deal orchestration.
- No ownership of measurable deal progression metrics.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps AEs keep deals moving with better visibility, buyer alignment, and less manual overhead.
- **30s**: If opportunities stall from poor coordination, Outreach gives AEs structured deal workflows and AI-assisted follow-through to sustain momentum.
- **2min**: AEs often lose velocity not from lack of effort but from fragmented execution between calls, follow-ups, and stakeholder management. Outreach brings those workflows together so AEs can identify risk earlier, stay aligned with buying committees, and spend more time on high-value selling activity. We can validate fit by measuring current stall points, task overhead, and cycle-time constraints.

### Next-Step CTA
- Analyze last-quarter stalled deals to identify repeatable execution gaps.
- Pilot AE workflows on one segment with cycle-time and conversion KPIs.
