# Customer Success Manager

## Overview
Customer Success Managers own retention and expansion outcomes after handoff from sales. They buy when they need better context continuity, fewer redundant conversations, and earlier risk detection for renewals.

## Role and Context
- **Role/Title**: Customer Success Manager, Account Manager, Renewal Manager.
- **Core Responsibilities**: Renewal health, expansion identification, relationship management, business outcome alignment.
- **Typical Company Context**: B2B recurring-revenue businesses with post-sales growth targets.

## Pains, Drivers, and Priorities
- **Top Pain Points**:
  - Poor context transfer from pre-sales to post-sales.
  - Late visibility into churn risk signals.
  - Repetitive customer interactions that reduce trust and efficiency.
- **Business Priorities**:
  - Improve retention and expansion predictability.
  - Align account conversations to measurable customer outcomes.
  - Reduce friction between sales and CS workflows.
- **Buying Triggers**:
  - Rising churn or renewal slippage.
  - Expansion pipeline underperformance.
  - Need for coordinated account workflows across teams.

## Buying Behavior
- **Decision Criteria**: Account visibility, risk signal quality, workflow coordination with sales, adoption simplicity.
- **Stakeholders**: CS leadership, Sales leadership, RevOps, Account teams.
- **Common Risks/Concerns**: Too sales-centric workflow, insufficient post-sales signal relevance.

## Messaging Guidance
- **What Resonates**: Retention risk visibility, shared account context, outcome-based customer engagement.
- **What to Avoid**: Messaging focused only on net-new pipeline without lifecycle value.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How early can your team reliably detect renewal risk today?
2. What context is typically lost between sales close and CS handoff?
3. Which expansion motions are hardest to operationalize consistently?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No post-sales KPI ownership for renewals/expansion.
- No need for coordinated account workflows across teams.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps CS teams reduce renewal risk with better account context and coordinated workflows.
- **30s**: If churn risk appears too late, Outreach aligns account signals and actions across teams so CSMs can intervene earlier and expand smarter.
- **2min**: CS teams often inherit incomplete context and then spend cycles rebuilding account understanding instead of driving outcomes. Outreach positions a shared workflow model where account insights and actions can be coordinated across sales and CS, reducing redundant conversations and improving renewal readiness. We can validate fit by reviewing your handoff quality, risk detection timing, and expansion process maturity.

### Next-Step CTA
- Review recent renewal losses for early warning signals that were missed.
- Pilot a cross-team account workflow for one renewal cohort.
