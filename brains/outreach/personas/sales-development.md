# Sales Development

## Overview
Sales Development (SDR/BDR leaders and reps) owns top-of-funnel pipeline generation. They buy when they need to improve message relevance, outreach productivity, and meeting conversion rates.

## Role and Context
- **Role/Title**: SDR, BDR, SDR Manager, Sales Development Leader.
- **Core Responsibilities**: Prospecting, outreach execution, qualification, meetings booked.
- **Typical Company Context**: Outbound-heavy B2B organizations with volume and efficiency pressure.

## Pains, Drivers, and Priorities
- **Top Pain Points**:
  - Low response and meeting conversion rates.
  - Manual personalization effort at scale.
  - Inconsistent execution across reps and channels.
- **Business Priorities**:
  - Generate more qualified pipeline with fewer wasted activities.
  - Increase productivity per rep.
  - Improve consistency of messaging and follow-up timing.
- **Buying Triggers**:
  - Pipeline targets increase without added SDR headcount.
  - Persistent underperformance in reply/meeting KPIs.
  - Need for better signal-based targeting and prioritization.

## Buying Behavior
- **Decision Criteria**: Ease of daily use, speed of execution, conversion impact, manager visibility.
- **Stakeholders**: Sales development leadership, RevOps, frontline sales managers.
- **Common Risks/Concerns**: Rep adoption friction, quality concerns with automation and AI-generated outreach.

## Messaging Guidance
- **What Resonates**: More meetings, less manual work, better targeting, repeatable workflows.
- **What to Avoid**: Overpromises on AI without clear guardrails for message quality.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Which part of your outbound workflow consumes the most rep time today?
2. What are your current conversion rates from activity to meetings and pipeline?
3. Where does rep-to-rep variability hurt team output most?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No outbound strategy or no SDR/BDR ownership model.
- No tracking of conversion metrics from outreach to pipeline.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps sales development teams generate more qualified pipeline with smarter, repeatable outreach workflows.
- **30s**: If your reps are overworked and conversion is inconsistent, Outreach combines structured engagement and AI support to increase output without sacrificing quality.
- **2min**: SDR teams usually know they need more pipeline but get stuck between volume pressure and personalization quality. Outreach addresses this by combining engagement workflows, account prioritization context, and AI-assisted execution in one platform. That helps reps move faster while keeping message relevance high. We can validate fit by benchmarking your current activity-to-meeting funnel and identifying where workflow improvements create the largest lift.

### Next-Step CTA
- Baseline SDR funnel metrics and identify top conversion drop-offs.
- Pilot AI-assisted outreach workflows for one segment and compare lift.
