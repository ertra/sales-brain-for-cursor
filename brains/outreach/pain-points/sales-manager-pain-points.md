# Sales Manager - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales managers are accountable for rep performance and pipeline quality but often lack enough time and signal clarity to coach effectively. Their pain centers on prioritization and intervention quality.

## Pain Point Breakdown

### 1. Hard to identify highest-risk deals fast enough
- **Description**: Risk signals are scattered and late, so managers discover issues after momentum is lost.
- **Business Impact**: More slipped deals and lower forecast confidence.
- **Current Workaround**: Manual deal reviews and rep narrative checks.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Deal, Forecast
- **Key Message**: Surface risk earlier so managers can intervene before deals stall.

### 2. Coaching quality varies by manager bandwidth
- **Description**: Managers cannot consistently review calls and behaviors across all reps.
- **Business Impact**: Uneven rep performance and slower ramp.
- **Current Workaround**: Spot coaching and reactive review sessions.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Meet, rep coaching capabilities
- **Key Message**: Scale coaching with conversation insights and action-oriented workflows.

### 3. Pipeline reviews become status meetings, not action meetings
- **Description**: Reviews focus on updates rather than specific next-best actions.
- **Business Impact**: Lower execution discipline and reduced conversion improvements.
- **Current Workaround**: Additional follow-up meetings and manual action tracking.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: Medium-High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Deal, Engage
- **Key Message**: Turn pipeline inspection into decision-quality interventions.

## Priority Matrix
| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Solution | Proof Availability |
|------------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------------|
| Late risk identification | High | Daily | Deal + Forecast | Medium |
| Coaching inconsistency | High | Weekly | Meet + coaching workflows | Medium |
| Status-heavy reviews | Medium-High | Weekly | Deal + Engage | Medium |

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How do managers currently prioritize which deals need intervention first?
2. What percentage of reps receive consistent coaching every week?
3. Which part of pipeline review is most manual and least actionable?

### Disqualification Criteria
- Manager does not own coaching and pipeline outcomes.
- Team has no recurring deal/pipeline review process to optimize.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps sales managers coach smarter and act earlier on pipeline risk.
- **30s**: If managers are overloaded, Outreach prioritizes deal and rep signals so they can focus attention where it moves outcomes most.
- **2min**: Frontline managers are usually constrained by time and signal noise, not intent. Outreach connects call intelligence, deal movement, and forecast context so managers can diagnose risk sooner and coach with more precision. That shifts pipeline reviews from passive updates to concrete actions. We can validate by tracking intervention timing, coaching coverage, and team conversion lift.

### Next-Step CTA
- Pilot a manager operating cadence focused on risk-first deal inspection.

## Trigger Events
- New manager cohort with coaching inconsistency.
- Increase in slipped deals.
- Forecast-call confidence drops across teams.
