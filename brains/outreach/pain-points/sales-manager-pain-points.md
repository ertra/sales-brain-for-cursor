# Sales Manager - Pain Points

## Overview
Sales managers are accountable for rep performance and pipeline quality but often lack enough time and signal clarity to coach effectively. Their pain centers on prioritization and intervention quality.

## Pain Point Breakdown

### 1. Hard to identify highest-risk deals fast enough
- **Description**: Risk signals are scattered and late, so managers discover issues after momentum is lost.
- **Business Impact**: More slipped deals and lower forecast confidence.
- **Current Workaround**: Manual deal reviews and rep narrative checks.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Deal, Forecast
- **Key Message**: Surface risk earlier so managers can intervene before deals stall.

### 2. Coaching quality varies by manager bandwidth
- **Description**: Managers cannot consistently review calls and behaviors across all reps.
- **Business Impact**: Uneven rep performance and slower ramp.
- **Current Workaround**: Spot coaching and reactive review sessions.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Meet, rep coaching capabilities
- **Key Message**: Scale coaching with conversation insights and action-oriented workflows.

### 3. Pipeline reviews become status meetings, not action meetings
- **Description**: Reviews focus on updates rather than specific next-best actions.
- **Business Impact**: Lower execution discipline and reduced conversion improvements.
- **Current Workaround**: Additional follow-up meetings and manual action tracking.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: Medium-High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Deal, Engage
- **Key Message**: Turn pipeline inspection into decision-quality interventions.

|------------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------------|
| Late risk identification | High | Daily | Deal + Forecast | Medium |
