# Customer Success Manager - Pain Points

## Overview
Customer Success Managers are measured on renewal and expansion outcomes but often inherit fragmented context and delayed risk signals. Their pain is coordinating proactive retention motions across teams.

## Pain Point Breakdown

### 1. Renewal risk detected too late
- **Description**: CSMs discover account risk only after engagement quality or usage momentum has declined.
- **Business Impact**: Higher churn risk and lower renewal predictability.
- **Current Workaround**: Manual health reviews and reactive escalations.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Forecast, account management workflows
- **Key Message**: Surface risk signals earlier so teams can intervene before renewals are endangered.

### 2. Sales-to-CS handoff loses crucial context
- **Description**: Promise details, stakeholder dynamics, and success criteria are not consistently transferred.
- **Business Impact**: Redundant customer conversations and slower time-to-value.
- **Current Workaround**: Internal sync calls and handoff docs that quickly go stale.
- **Frequency**: Per account transition
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Meet, account management capabilities
- **Key Message**: Preserve account context across the full customer lifecycle.

### 3. Expansion opportunities are hard to systematize
- **Description**: Teams spot expansion chances inconsistently and late.
- **Business Impact**: Missed growth potential and unpredictable net revenue retention.
- **Current Workaround**: Rep memory and account-by-account intuition.
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Severity**: Medium-High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Amplify, account orchestration workflows
- **Key Message**: Turn retention and expansion signals into repeatable account actions.

## Priority Matrix
| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Solution | Proof Availability |
|------------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------------|
| Late renewal risk | High | Weekly | Forecast + account workflows | Medium |
| Handoff context loss | High | Per transition | Meet + account visibility | Medium |
| Inconsistent expansion motion | Medium-High | Monthly | Amplify + orchestration | Low |

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How early can your team reliably identify churn risk by account tier?
2. What is usually missing from sales-to-CS handoff context?
3. How are expansion plays triggered and prioritized today?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No ownership of renewal or expansion KPIs.
- No cross-functional willingness to align sales and CS account workflows.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps CSMs reduce churn risk with earlier signals and better account context.
- **30s**: If renewals are reactive, Outreach aligns account workflows across teams to help CSMs intervene earlier and expand smarter.
- **2min**: CS teams often know outcomes are at risk but discover it too late because signals and context are fragmented. Outreach positions a connected workflow model so account insights, conversation context, and next-step actions are easier to operationalize. This reduces redundant customer interactions and improves renewal planning discipline. We can validate fit by measuring risk-detection timing, handoff quality, and expansion conversion.

### Next-Step CTA
- Audit the last 10 at-risk renewals to map early signals that were missed.

## Trigger Events
- Churn uptick in key segments.
- CSM span-of-control increase.
- Expansion attainment misses.
