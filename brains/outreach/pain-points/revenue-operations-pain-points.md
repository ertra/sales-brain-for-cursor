# Revenue Operations - Pain Points

## Overview
RevOps teams struggle with funnel leakage, fragmented process execution, and manual forecasting workflows. Their central pain is turning disconnected systems into one reliable operating model.

## Pain Point Breakdown

### 1. Funnel leakage and process inconsistency
- **Description**: Pipeline stages and handoffs are not consistently managed across teams.
- **Business Impact**: Lower conversion rates, hidden risk, and unreliable performance diagnostics.
- **Current Workaround**: Manual audits, additional pipeline governance meetings, local process patches.
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Deal, Pipeline management capabilities
- **Key Message**: Identify and fix leak, inefficiency, and risk with shared execution workflows.

### 2. Tool sprawl across engagement, deal, and forecast systems
- **Description**: Critical signals are spread across multiple point tools.
- **Business Impact**: Data reconciliation overhead, slower reporting cycles, and low trust in insights.
- **Current Workaround**: Spreadsheet stitching and downstream BI cleanup.
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Unified platform packages (Engage, Deal, Forecast, Meet)
- **Key Message**: Consolidate execution context into one platform to reduce operational drag.

### 3. Manual and slow forecast prep
- **Description**: Forecast cycles rely on manual roll-ups and exception chasing.
- **Business Impact**: Delayed decisions, weak scenario planning, and heavy RevOps toil.
- **Current Workaround**: Multiple review cadences and one-off data pulls.
- **Frequency**: Weekly / Monthly
- **Severity**: High
- **Mapped Product Solution**: Forecast
- **Key Message**: Automate forecast workflows with rollups and scenario planning to improve speed and confidence.
