# Use Case: Scale Rep Productivity Without Headcount

## Overview
Revenue teams need more output from existing sellers. This use case addresses rep admin overload and inconsistent execution by applying AI-assisted workflows to core daily motions.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: B2B teams with high activity targets and constrained hiring plans.
- **Primary Persona**: Sales Development
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Manager, Account Executive, Revenue Operations
- **Trigger Event**: Pipeline targets increase but hiring budgets remain flat.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Reps spend heavy time on repetitive tasks and inconsistent follow-up.
- **Desired State**: More rep time allocated to selling with standardized, AI-assisted execution.
- **Solution Overview**: Deploy Engage + Amplify workflows for prioritization, personalization, and repeatable sequence execution.

## Implementation Path
1. Measure current rep time allocation and funnel conversion baselines.
2. Roll out standardized sequence and follow-up templates in Engage.
3. Enable AI-assisted prospecting/personalization via Amplify use cases.
4. Compare pilot cohort productivity and conversion against control group.
