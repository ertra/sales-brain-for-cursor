# Use Case: Scale Rep Productivity Without Headcount

## Overview
Revenue teams need more output from existing sellers. This use case addresses rep admin overload and inconsistent execution by applying AI-assisted workflows to core daily motions.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: B2B teams with high activity targets and constrained hiring plans.
- **Primary Persona**: Sales Development
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Manager, Account Executive, Revenue Operations
- **Trigger Event**: Pipeline targets increase but hiring budgets remain flat.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Reps spend heavy time on repetitive tasks and inconsistent follow-up.
- **Desired State**: More rep time allocated to selling with standardized, AI-assisted execution.
- **Solution Overview**: Deploy Engage + Amplify workflows for prioritization, personalization, and repeatable sequence execution.

## Implementation Path
1. Measure current rep time allocation and funnel conversion baselines.
2. Roll out standardized sequence and follow-up templates in Engage.
3. Enable AI-assisted prospecting/personalization via Amplify use cases.
4. Compare pilot cohort productivity and conversion against control group.

## Value Delivered
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Seller productivity | Up to 60% claim with AI-driven workflows |
| Meeting booking rate | +25% listed in BrightTALK story summary |
| Positive reply rate | +66% listed in BrightTALK story summary |

## Evidence & Sources
- **Claim**: Outreach claims up to 60% seller productivity increase through AI-driven workflows. | **Source**: Outreach homepage/platform (`https://www.outreach.io/`, `https://www.outreach.io/platform`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. What percentage of rep time is non-selling admin today?
2. Which conversion step is weakest: reply, meeting, or qualified opportunity?
3. How much rep-to-rep execution variance exists on your team?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No measurable KPI ownership for rep productivity.
- No willingness to standardize outreach workflow behaviors.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps teams raise seller output without adding proportional headcount.
- **30s**: If reps are overloaded, Outreach uses structured engagement and AI assistance to convert more effort into pipeline outcomes.
- **2min**: Productivity constraints usually come from process inconsistency and repetitive manual work, not effort. Outreach positions a workflow model where reps can execute faster with better guidance, while managers and RevOps maintain consistency across the team.

### Next-Step CTA
- Launch a productivity pilot on one outbound segment with pre/post KPI scorecard.

## Demo Focus (Optional)
- Sequence execution and automation triggers
- AI personalization workflows
