# Use Case: Predictable Forecast and Pipeline Visibility

## Overview
Revenue leadership teams need a reliable, shared view of forecast and pipeline risk. This use case focuses on replacing reactive forecasting motions with earlier risk detection and consistent inspection workflows.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: Mid-market to enterprise B2B organizations with multi-manager sales teams.
- **Primary Persona**: Sales Leader
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Revenue Operations, Sales Managers, Finance
- **Trigger Event**: Forecast misses, commit volatility, or board pressure for tighter predictability.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Forecasting is spreadsheet-heavy and pipeline risks are discovered late.
- **Desired State**: One execution system where pipeline and forecast signals are visible early and acted on quickly.
- **Solution Overview**: Use Forecast and Deal workflows to surface risk, standardize reviews, and improve intervention quality.

## Implementation Path
1. Baseline forecast variance and pipeline leakage by stage.
2. Configure forecast rollups and risk-oriented review cadence.
3. Standardize manager intervention workflows on high-risk deals.
4. Track impact on commit quality and cycle-time predictability.

## Value Delivered

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Where does commit accuracy break down most often?
2. Which pipeline risks are usually discovered too late?
3. How much manager time is spent reconciling forecast status?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No executive ownership of forecast quality.
- No measurable business impact from forecast variance.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps leaders move from reactive forecasting to predictable pipeline execution.
- **30s**: If forecast confidence is low, Outreach provides shared risk visibility and standardized intervention workflows.
- **2min**: Most teams do not fail forecasting because of lack of data, but because signals are late and operating cadences vary by manager. Outreach is positioned to connect deal and pipeline workflows with forecasting so risk can be identified and acted on earlier.

### Next-Step CTA
- Run a 2-quarter forecast variance and stage-risk diagnostic workshop.

## Demo Focus (Optional)
- Forecast rollup and scenario views
- Deal health and risk prioritization
- Manager workflow for intervention tracking
