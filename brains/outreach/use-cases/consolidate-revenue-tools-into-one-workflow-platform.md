# Use Case: Consolidate Revenue Tools into One Workflow Platform

## Overview
Teams with fragmented sales tooling face process friction, poor visibility, and rising operating cost. This use case targets organizations consolidating engagement, deal, forecast, and conversation workflows into a single operating system.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: Mid-market and enterprise organizations with mature but fragmented GTM stack.
- **Primary Persona**: Revenue Operations
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Leader, Sales Manager, IT
- **Trigger Event**: Executive initiative to reduce tool sprawl and improve process consistency.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Revenue workflows are spread across disconnected tools with high reconciliation overhead.
- **Desired State**: One platform for pipeline generation, deal execution, forecasting, and account orchestration.
- **Solution Overview**: Deploy role-based Outreach packages (Engage, Meet, Deal, Forecast, Amplify) under one workflow model.

## Implementation Path
1. Map current revenue workflow by system and handoff.
2. Prioritize high-friction motions for consolidation in phase one.
3. Migrate selected teams onto package-based workflows.
4. Measure efficiency, adoption, and data-quality improvements.
