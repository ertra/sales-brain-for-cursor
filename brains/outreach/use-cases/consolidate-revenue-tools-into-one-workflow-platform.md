# Use Case: Consolidate Revenue Tools into One Workflow Platform

## Overview
Teams with fragmented sales tooling face process friction, poor visibility, and rising operating cost. This use case targets organizations consolidating engagement, deal, forecast, and conversation workflows into a single operating system.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: Mid-market and enterprise organizations with mature but fragmented GTM stack.
- **Primary Persona**: Revenue Operations
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Leader, Sales Manager, IT
- **Trigger Event**: Executive initiative to reduce tool sprawl and improve process consistency.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Revenue workflows are spread across disconnected tools with high reconciliation overhead.
- **Desired State**: One platform for pipeline generation, deal execution, forecasting, and account orchestration.
- **Solution Overview**: Deploy role-based Outreach packages (Engage, Meet, Deal, Forecast, Amplify) under one workflow model.

## Implementation Path
1. Map current revenue workflow by system and handoff.
2. Prioritize high-friction motions for consolidation in phase one.
3. Migrate selected teams onto package-based workflows.
4. Measure efficiency, adoption, and data-quality improvements.

## Value Delivered
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Platform fees | No platform fees (pricing model claim) |
| Tool handoff complexity | Reduced via shared workflow model |
| Forecast/reporting prep effort | To be verified |

## Evidence & Sources
- **Claim**: Outreach positions itself as the only end-to-end sales solution and one platform for Lead Gen, Sales, CS, and RevOps. | **Source**: Outreach homepage/platform (`https://www.outreach.io/`, `https://www.outreach.io/platform`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20
- **Claim**: Outreach pricing states per-user pricing with no platform fees and package-based capability model. | **Source**: Outreach pricing (`https://www.outreach.io/pricing`) | **Date**: 2026-02-20

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How many tools are currently required to run your core revenue workflows?
2. Which handoffs create the most delay or data-quality issues?
3. What consolidation outcomes matter most: cost, visibility, or execution consistency?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No stack rationalization initiative.
- No cross-functional sponsorship for platform-level change.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps teams replace fragmented revenue tooling with one workflow platform.
- **30s**: If your stack is creating process drag, Outreach consolidates key motions so teams execute faster with clearer shared visibility.
- **2min**: Many organizations buy best-of-breed tools over time and end up with workflow fragmentation and reporting friction. Outreach positions an integrated package model for prospecting, deal execution, conversation intelligence, and forecasting, which can simplify operations and improve consistency across teams.

### Next-Step CTA
- Run a tool-sprawl and workflow-friction assessment across GTM functions.

## Demo Focus (Optional)
- Multi-role workflow coverage across packages
- Shared data and process views
- Governance and role-based execution controls
