# Use Case: Improve Renewal and Expansion Execution

## Overview
Post-sales teams need earlier churn-risk visibility and better cross-team account coordination. This use case focuses on reducing reactive renewals and creating more repeatable expansion execution.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: Recurring-revenue B2B companies with CS and account teams.
- **Primary Persona**: Customer Success Manager
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Leader, Account Executive, Revenue Operations
- **Trigger Event**: Rising churn risk, inconsistent renewal predictability, or missed expansion targets.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Renewal risks are identified late and account context is fragmented across teams.
- **Desired State**: Shared account workflows with earlier risk signals and coordinated next steps.
- **Solution Overview**: Apply account management and AI orchestration workflows to retention and expansion motions.

## Implementation Path
1. Define renewal-risk and expansion-trigger signals by segment.
2. Align sales and CS on shared account handoff and review cadence.
3. Deploy AI-assisted account workflows for early intervention and opportunity routing.
4. Track retention and expansion KPI lift against baseline.
