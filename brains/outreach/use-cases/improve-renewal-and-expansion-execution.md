# Use Case: Improve Renewal and Expansion Execution

## Overview
Post-sales teams need earlier churn-risk visibility and better cross-team account coordination. This use case focuses on reducing reactive renewals and creating more repeatable expansion execution.

## Context
- **Target Company Profile**: Recurring-revenue B2B companies with CS and account teams.
- **Primary Persona**: Customer Success Manager
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Sales Leader, Account Executive, Revenue Operations
- **Trigger Event**: Rising churn risk, inconsistent renewal predictability, or missed expansion targets.

## Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome
- **Current State**: Renewal risks are identified late and account context is fragmented across teams.
- **Desired State**: Shared account workflows with earlier risk signals and coordinated next steps.
- **Solution Overview**: Apply account management and AI orchestration workflows to retention and expansion motions.

## Implementation Path
1. Define renewal-risk and expansion-trigger signals by segment.
2. Align sales and CS on shared account handoff and review cadence.
3. Deploy AI-assisted account workflows for early intervention and opportunity routing.
4. Track retention and expansion KPI lift against baseline.

## Value Delivered
| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Renewal risk detection timing | Earlier intervention model (To be verified) |
| Expansion opportunity capture | Listed +68% expansion opps in Workato story summary |
| Seller productivity for lifecycle teams | Up to 60% claim with AI workflows |

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. How early do you currently detect renewal risk in top accounts?
2. Where does account context break between sales and CS?
3. What process currently drives expansion opportunity identification?

### Disqualification Criteria
- No ownership of retention/expansion KPIs.
- No cross-functional alignment between sales and CS.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach helps teams catch renewal risk earlier and execute expansion with more consistency.
- **30s**: If renewals are reactive, Outreach connects account signals and workflows so CS and sales can act sooner and grow more predictably.
- **2min**: Retention and expansion breakdowns usually come from delayed signals and fragmented account ownership. Outreach positions a workflow model where teams share context and run coordinated plays across the lifecycle, improving renewal confidence and increasing expansion execution quality.

### Next-Step CTA
- Run a renewal-risk retrospective and define top intervention opportunities.
