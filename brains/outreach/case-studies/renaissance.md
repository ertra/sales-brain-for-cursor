## Operator Guidance
### Best-Fit Usage
- **Persona**: Sales Manager, Sales Leader, Revenue Operations
- **Industry**: Competitive, relationship-heavy B2B markets
- **Use Case**: Convert manual sales process into data-driven execution engine

### Discovery Questions
1. Which sales activities are currently measured but not actionably optimized?
2. How manual is your current rep-to-manager workflow after customer interactions?
3. What adoption level would you require for rollout success?

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Renaissance used Outreach to turn manual sales motions into a high-adoption, data-driven execution model.
- **30s**: If your team lacks insight into what activities actually move conversion, this case shows measurable lift from execution intelligence.
- **2min**: Renaissance identified that manual workflows were consuming seller time without generating actionable insight. Outreach gave leaders rep-level and funnel-level visibility, enabling optimized workflows and high adoption. That combination of adoption plus insight contributed to large conversion gains.

### Next-Step CTA
- Launch a conversion-improvement pilot with adoption and activity-quality scorecards.
