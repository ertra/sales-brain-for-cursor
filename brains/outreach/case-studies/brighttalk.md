### Discovery Questions
1. How much rep-level visibility do you have into sequence and follow-up effectiveness?
2. Are sales and marketing aligned on which messages produce positive replies?
3. Which conversion step is your largest bottleneck: replies, meetings, or qualification?

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: BrightTALK improved meetings and reply quality by operationalizing rep execution with Outreach.
- **30s**: If your team lacks rep-level clarity, this case shows how visibility plus coaching workflows can materially improve outbound conversion.
- **2min**: BrightTALK moved from limited sequence-level insight to a more granular, data-driven model where leaders could coach reps using performance and sentiment signals. That alignment between frontline execution and message optimization translated into measurable lift in meetings and positive replies.

### Next-Step CTA
- Run a 30-day rep-level outbound effectiveness pilot with meeting/reply baseline tracking.
