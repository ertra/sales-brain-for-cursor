# Target Companies

## Overview
Outreach targets B2B revenue organizations that need to improve pipeline generation, deal execution, and forecast confidence across sales, RevOps, marketing, and customer success. The strongest fit is companies with multi-role revenue teams, process/tool fragmentation, and measurable pressure to improve seller productivity without equivalent headcount growth.

## ICP Segments

### Mid-Market and Enterprise B2B Revenue Teams
- **Industry**: Software, IT/services, telecom, financial services, manufacturing, logistics, and business services.
- **Size**: Mid-market to enterprise (Outreach: 3,300+ companies, 50,000+ reps; commonly multi-team revenue organizations; vendor claim).
- **Characteristics**: Multi-role GTM teams (Sales, RevOps, CS, Marketing) with complex pipeline and forecast motions.
- **Buying Triggers**: Forecast inconsistency, need for pipeline efficiency, and pressure to align teams on one execution workflow.
- **Common Challenges**: Disjointed revenue tooling, inconsistent manager inspection, weak deal/risk visibility.
- **Disqualify If**: No formal revenue process ownership; no need for cross-functional workflow alignment; no KPI pressure on forecast or productivity.

### High-Growth Outbound-Focused Organizations
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS and tech-enabled services (plus adjacent outbound-heavy sectors).
- **Size**: Typically 20+ revenue reps scaling outbound (vendor positioning; no public band).
- **Characteristics**: SDR/BDR and AE teams scaling outreach volume and account coverage.
- **Buying Triggers**: Need to improve seller productivity and run repeatable, AI-assisted prospecting motions.
- **Common Challenges**: Inconsistent outbound quality, low conversion from activity to qualified pipeline, manual follow-up overhead.
- **Disqualify If**: No outbound motion; no sequence/process governance; low willingness to adopt workflow standardization.

### Revenue Organizations Seeking Tool Consolidation
- **Industry**: Cross-industry B2B with maturing RevOps function.
- **Size**: Mid-market and enterprise with maturing RevOps (vendor positioning).
- **Characteristics**: Existing stack sprawl across engagement, call intelligence, deal management, and forecasting.
- **Buying Triggers**: Cost and complexity from multiple tools; demand for one platform view of revenue execution.
- **Common Challenges**: Data/context switching across tools, fragmented reporting, inconsistent user adoption.
- **Disqualify If**: Long-term lock-in to incumbent systems with no consolidation mandate; no executive sponsor for platform consolidation.

## Operator Guidance
### Discovery Questions
1. Which revenue team workflows are currently fragmented across tools (prospecting, deal management, forecasting, coaching, customer expansion)?
2. Which KPI is under greatest pressure this quarter: pipeline creation, win rate, forecast accuracy, or seller productivity?
3. Where does process inconsistency show up most today: rep execution, manager coaching, or cross-team handoffs?

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Outreach fits revenue teams that need one AI workflow platform to generate pipeline, execute deals, and forecast with confidence.
- **30s**: If your revenue process spans multiple disconnected tools, Outreach helps unify execution across sales, RevOps, and customer teams while improving productivity and visibility.
- **2min**: We see strongest fit in organizations where growth targets are rising but headcount and manager bandwidth are constrained. Those teams typically have tool sprawl, inconsistent pipeline execution, and unreliable forecasting. Outreach is positioned as a single AI revenue workflow platform with packaged capabilities for engagement, calls, conversations, deals, and forecasts. The practical value is tighter process consistency, better operational visibility, and less time lost to context switching. We can validate fit by mapping your current workflow stack, identifying conversion/forecast bottlenecks, and sizing consolidation plus productivity impact.

### Next-Step CTA
- Run an ICP fit workshop mapping team structure, workflow fragmentation, and top KPIs.
- Prioritize one segment and one workflow to pilot (for example: outbound execution or forecast predictability).
