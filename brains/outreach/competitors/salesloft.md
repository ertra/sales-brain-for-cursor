## Product and Positioning

- **Core Message**: Unify revenue workflows and turn insights into action across the buyer journey.
- **Target Market**: B2B revenue teams seeking one platform across pipeline, deal, and forecasting workflows.

## Where They Win / Lose
- **Strengths**:
  - Strong "one platform" orchestration narrative.
  - Broad product footprint including chat (Drift), forecasting, and engagement.
  - AI-agent and workflow automation emphasis.
  - Clear pipeline and forecast-oriented messaging.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Breadth can increase complexity in adoption/scoping.
  - Potential overlap with incumbent systems can create implementation friction.
  - Differentiation versus Outreach can narrow when buyers prioritize multi-team orchestration and execution depth.
  - Outcome proof should be validated per segment rather than assumed.

## Feature and Outcome Comparison
| Feature/Outcome | Us | Salesloft | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----|-----------|----------------|
| Unified platform for Lead Gen, Sales, CS, RevOps | ✅ | ⚠️ | Both claim broad coverage; buyer must validate execution quality per workflow. |
| Seller productivity with AI workflows | ✅ | ✅ | Productivity promise is table stakes; proof and adoption model win deals. |
| Forecast + deal + engagement connection | ✅ | ✅ | Shared surface is critical for reducing workflow fragmentation. |
| Website chat native module | ❌ | ✅ | Salesloft can win where chat-native requirement is mandatory. |

## Battlecard
### When We Win
- Buyer prioritizes end-to-end revenue workflow consistency across sales, RevOps, and CS.
- Deal centers on execution quality, adoption speed, and measurable outcomes.

### When They Win
- Buyer requires built-in chat-native capability in same vendor.
- Existing Salesloft footprint or champion strongly shapes evaluation criteria.

### Their Claims vs Reality
