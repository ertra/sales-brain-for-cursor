## Operator Guidance
### Trap-Setting Questions

### Disqualification Criteria
- Buyer has strategic standardization mandate on Gong.
- Scope requires very limited capabilities outside existing incumbent.

### Talk Tracks
- **15s**: Gong is a strong AI revenue platform; Outreach competes by focusing on practical cross-team execution outcomes.
- **30s**: If you need predictable execution across prospecting, deals, and forecasting, we should compare both platforms on adoption speed and KPI impact, not category labels.
