# Target Companies / Customer Segments

## Overview
LAUTIE sells primarily **direct to consumers** (D2C) via lautie.com with worldwide shipping. Target "companies" in a sales context include individual buyers (fidget and EDC enthusiasts, collectors, gift givers) and, where relevant, **retail or B2B** opportunities (specialty retailers, corporate/employee gifting). This document describes the main customer segments and any company-type accounts.
