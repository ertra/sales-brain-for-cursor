# Target Companies / Customer Segments

## Overview
LAUTIE sells primarily **direct to consumers** (D2C) via lautie.com with worldwide shipping. Target "companies" in a sales context include individual buyers (fidget and EDC enthusiasts, collectors, gift givers) and, where relevant, **retail or B2B** opportunities (specialty retailers, corporate/employee gifting). This document describes the main customer segments and any company-type accounts.

## Customer / Company Profiles

### Fidget & EDC Enthusiasts (Primary)
- **Industry / segment**: Consumer; hobbyist / EDC community
- **Size**: Individual purchasers; often repeat buyers and community members (e.g. LAUTIE EDC Facebook Group)
- **Characteristics**: Interest in stress relief, focus, and tactile satisfaction; value metal quality and design; follow releases and limited editions
- **Why They Buy**: Premium metal fidgets (spinners, sliders, rings); collectibility; brand identity ("Stay Cool & Be Different"); in-house quality and series (Noiz, Choc, Mechanic, etc.)
- **Common Challenges**: Finding durable, non-cheap alternatives; wanting discreet or wearable options (rings, pendants); choosing among many SKUs and price points

### Collectors & Limited-Edition Buyers
- **Industry / segment**: Consumer; collectibles / premium EDC
- **Size**: Individual; sometimes multi-unit orders (variants, co-brands)
- **Characteristics**: Seek limited editions, co-brands (PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC, OneBean), and flagship items (e.g. Jackpot 2.0, Carnival-Mega)
- **Why They Buy**: Rarity, series completion, resale or display; quality and brand reputation
- **Common Challenges**: Availability of limited runs; timing of drops; international shipping and cost

### Gift Buyers
- **Industry / segment**: Consumer; gifting (occasions, corporate gifts)
- **Size**: Individual or small bulk (e.g. team gifts)
- **Characteristics**: Buying for others who like fidget, EDC, or unique gadgets; may not be enthusiasts themselves
- **Why They Buy**: Perceived quality and novelty; clear product categories and price ranges; free shipping over $50
- **Common Challenges**: Choosing the right product type (spinner vs. slider vs. ring); budget vs. premium; delivery time

### Specialty Retailers & Distributors (B2B – potential)
- **Industry / segment**: Retail; EDC, hobby, gift, or outdoor stores
- **Size**: Small to mid-size retailers; single or multi-location
- **Characteristics**: Stock curated EDC and fidget products; may sell online and in-store
- **Why They Buy**: Brand recognition; margin potential; product variety and quality; appeal to existing EDC/fidget customer base
- **Common Challenges**: MOQs, pricing, and terms; exclusivity vs. D2C; inventory and lead times

### Corporate / Employee Gifting (B2B – potential)
- **Industry / segment**: Any; HR, wellness, or employee engagement
- **Size**: Companies of any size; often 10–500+ units
- **Characteristics**: Looking for distinctive, non-generic gifts; wellness or focus themes (stress relief, focus)
- **Why They Buy**: Premium feel; broad price range; worldwide shipping; brand story (craftsman/designer, in-house manufacturing)
- **Common Challenges**: Bulk pricing and customization; delivery windows; matching product to audience

## Geographic Focus
- **Primary**: Worldwide (site and shipping are international; USD pricing; free shipping over $50 USD)
- No explicit region restriction; appeal is global for EDC/fidget community

## Additional Notes
- Site and content emphasize D2C; no public wholesale or B2B portal noted. B2B segments above are inferred opportunities, not confirmed programs.
- Community (e.g. Facebook Group, fan photos) indicates strong repeat and advocate customers.
