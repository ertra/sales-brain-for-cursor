# Use Case: Collecting Limited Editions and Co-Brands

## Overview
A collector tracks LAUTIE drops and co-brands (e.g. PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC, OneBean) and flagship series (2099, Spy Wars, Jackpot, Carnival-Mega) to complete a collection or secure grail pieces. They use the newsletter and news for timing, and worldwide shipping with free ship over $50 to order with minimal friction.

## Context

### Customer Profile
- **Segment**: Collector & limited-edition buyer
- **Setting**: Personal collection; may display, trade, or resell; engaged in EDC/collector communities
- **Characteristics**: Values rarity, series continuity, and brand story; willing to pay premium; sensitive to missing drops and international cost

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Collector & Limited-Edition Buyer
- **Secondary**: Fidget Enthusiast (overlap: quality and use, plus collectibility)

### Trigger Event
- Announcement of limited run or co-brand; restock of sought-after item; desire to complete a series or add a flagship; FOMO from community or resale market

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Limited runs sell out before they can buy; unclear when things drop or restock
- International shipping and cost add friction; high-ticket items amplify total cost
- Many series and co-brands; hard to prioritize (budget/space) and plan

### Desired State (After)
- Timely access to drops and restocks via newsletter and news
- Ability to order from anywhere with clear shipping and free ship over $50
- Clear “universe” of series and co-brands so collecting feels intentional and valuable

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Limited editions, co-brands (PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC, OneBean), and flagship items (Jackpot 2.0, Carnival-Mega, Mechanic-I limited, Mystery Bags, etc.)
- **Supporting**: Protective cases (e.g. PELICAN), Storage Pouch, Leather Scroll for display/storage; standard lineup for “fill-in” or entry to a series

### Solution Overview
LAUTIE announces drops and “coming soon” via News and newsletter so collectors can plan. Series (2099, Spy Wars, EDC House) and co-brands create a clear collectible universe. Worldwide shipping and free shipping over $50 reduce friction for international and multi-item orders. In-house quality supports perception of value and resale.

### Implementation Steps
1. Subscribe to newsletter; check News for “coming soon” and drop dates.
2. Set budget and priority (e.g. one co-brand drop vs. series completion vs. flagship).
3. At drop or restock: order quickly; consider free shipping threshold with additional item or accessory.
4. Store or display; use protective case or pouch for premium pieces if desired.

## Value Delivered
