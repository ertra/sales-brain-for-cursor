# Use Case: Desk and Pocket Fidget for Focus and Stress Relief

## Overview
An individual (remote or office worker, student, creative) uses a premium metal spinner or slider at their desk or in their pocket to maintain focus and manage stress during work or study—replacing cheap fidgets that broke or failed to satisfy.

## Context

### Customer Profile
- **Segment**: Fidget & EDC enthusiast; may be first-time premium buyer or upgrading
- **Setting**: Desk job, hybrid/remote, or study; needs tactile outlet during concentration or idle moments
- **Characteristics**: Values durability and feel; may have tried plastic or low-quality metal fidgets before

### Primary Persona

- **Secondary**: Gift recipient (if product was a gift that sparked the use case)

### Trigger Event

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)

- Repeatedly replacing or tolerating poor quality
- Less effective stress relief and focus; sometimes abandoning fidgeting
- Uncertainty about which premium product to try first

### Desired State (After)
- One (or a small set of) durable, satisfying fidget(s) for desk and pocket

- **Supporting**: EDC accessories (Storage Pouch, Leather Slip); DIY (Bearings, Polishing Tool) for maintenance

### Solution Overview

4. Use at desk or in pocket; maintain with polishing tool or bearings if desired.
