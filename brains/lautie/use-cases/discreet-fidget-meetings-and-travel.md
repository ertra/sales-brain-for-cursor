# Use Case: Discreet Fidget in Meetings and Travel

## Overview
Someone who benefits from fidgeting but can’t use a visible desk spinner in meetings, on calls, or in public uses a LAUTIE ring or pendant for subtle, on-body fidgeting—so they get tactile relief without drawing attention.

## Context

### Customer Profile
- **Segment**: Fidget & EDC enthusiast (often office worker, frequent traveler, or professional)
- **Setting**: Meetings, video calls, transit, coffee shop, or any setting where a spinner on the desk would be inappropriate or awkward
- **Characteristics**: Wants to fidget for focus or stress relief but needs discretion; may already use a desk spinner at home

### Primary Persona
- **Role**: Fidget & EDC Enthusiast
- **Secondary**: Gift recipient (ring or pendant as gift for “someone who’s always on calls”)

### Trigger Event
- New job or role with more meetings; feedback that desk fidget is distracting; travel or co-working where desk spinner isn’t practical; desire to fidget during long calls or commutes

## The Challenge

### Current State (Before)
- Desk spinner not acceptable in meetings or public; put away or left at home
- No satisfying alternative—pen clicking, leg bouncing, or going without
- Stress or restlessness when they’d benefit most from subtle fidgeting
- Unaware that wearable options (ring, pendant) exist or are “real” fidgets

### Desired State (After)
- Subtle, always-available fidget (worn on finger or neck) for meetings, calls, and travel
- No need to explain or draw attention; looks like jewelry or EDC, functions as fidget
- Same brand and quality as their desk/pocket fidgets

## The Solution

### Products Involved
- **Primary**: Fidget Rings (Mechanic-C, Mechanic-E, Mechanic-I, Mechanic-Thorns) or Pendants (Resistor, Capsule, Sugar Cube, Pointer, GAS Bead)
- **Supporting**: Magnetic Leather Pouch (e.g. for Mechanic-I) for storage when not worn; EDC accessories

### Solution Overview
LAUTIE rings (Mechanic series) and pendants offer mechanical or tactile interaction in a wearable form. Worn on finger or chain, they’re always available for subtle fidgeting during meetings, calls, or travel. High ratings (e.g. Mechanic-I 4.89/5, Resistor 4.96/5) and “wearable” positioning address “will it work / look okay?” concerns.

### Implementation Steps
1. Decide form: ring (finger) vs. pendant (neck/lanyard); consider style and dress code.
2. Choose product: Mechanic series for rings (sizing, material); Resistor, Capsule, or others for pendants.
3. Order; check sizing for rings.
4. Wear daily; use in meetings/calls/travel as needed; store in pouch when not worn if desired.

## Value Delivered

### Outcome Benefits
| Outcome | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Fidget in meetings/travel | No or inappropriate | Subtle, on-body option always available |
| Social acceptability | Desk spinner = distracting | Ring/pendant = jewelry/EDC, not “toy” |
| Consistency with brand | Different brand for wearable | Same LAUTIE quality and identity |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Better focus and stress management in high-stakes or public settings
- No need to hide or explain; product fits professional or casual context
- Expands “where I can fidget” without compromising quality

## Proof Points

### Evidence
- Mechanic-I 4.89/5 (64+ reviews); Resistor 4.96/5; Mechanic-C, Mechanic-Thorns highly rated
- “Wearable” and “discreet” use cases on site and in community
- Multiple materials and sizes (e.g. Mechanic-I $39.90–$129.90) for different styles and budgets

## Sales / Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions
1. “Do you need something you can use in meetings or on the go without it being obvious?”
2. “Would you prefer a ring you can wear on your finger or a pendant on a chain/lanyard?”
3. “Are you looking for something that fits a more formal setting or casual everyday?”

### Key Talking Points
- Fidget without the spotlight—rings and pendants you can wear
- Same premium metal and in-house quality as our spinners and sliders
