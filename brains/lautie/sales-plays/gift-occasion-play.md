# Sales Play: Gift Occasion

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play name** | Gift Occasion |
| **Target persona** | Gift Buyer |
| **Target** | Individual or small group (e.g. team) buying a gift for someone who likes gadgets, stress relief, or “something different” |
| **Products** | Any category—Spinners, Sliders, Rings, Pendants—chosen by recipient profile and budget |
| **Trigger** | Seasonal (holidays, Valentine’s, etc.); life events (birthday, promotion, thank-you); search “unique gift,” “gift for colleague,” “stress relief gift” |
| **Play type** | Inbound / seasonal / campaign |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Calendar: 2–4 weeks before major gifting holidays (Christmas, Valentine’s, Mother’s/Father’s Day, etc.)
- Search/intent: “unique gift,” “gift for someone who has everything,” “stress relief gift,” “desk gift”
- Occasion-based landing or campaign: “Gifts for grads,” “Thank your team,” “Birthday gifts that aren’t generic”

### Ideal Signals
- Visitor on “best selling” or category pages without clear “for me” language
- Cart with one item; budget-conscious (filtering by price)
- Traffic from gift guides or “alternative gift” content

### Qualification (implicit)
| Criteria | Indication |
|----------|------------|
| Intent | Buying for someone else; occasion-driven |
| Budget | Often $25–80 for one gift; may bundle for free shipping |
| Need | Clear product type and “why this gift” story |

## The Play

### Objective
Make it easy for gift buyers to choose the right product type and price, feel confident it’s “thoughtful” and premium, and get it by the occasion.

### Value Proposition for This Play
“Something for every style—desk, pocket, or wear it. Premium metal at any budget. A gift that says you get them. We ship worldwide; order in time for the big day.”

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Surface “gift” path (site / campaigns)
- **Where**: Homepage banner or section (“Gifts”), category intros, “Best for gifting” or “Thoughtful gifts”
- **Message**: “Stress relief and focus—something different”; “Match the form to them”; “Premium at any budget”
- **CTA**: “Find a gift,” “Shop by occasion,” or “Best sellers for gifting”

### Step 2: Simplify choice
- **Categories**: “Desk or pocket?” → Spinners, Sliders. “Subtle or wearable?” → Rings, Pendants.
- **Safe bets**: Call out 1–2 “great for gifting” (e.g. Resistor, Choc, Mechanic-I) with short “why” (versatile, highly rated, premium feel).
- **Price**: Filters and “Under $30,” “$30–60,” “$60+” so they can match budget.
- **Free shipping**: “Add a pouch or second item for free shipping over $50.”

### Step 3: Reduce delivery anxiety
- **Shipping copy**: “We ship worldwide”; “Order by [date] for delivery by [holiday]” (if applicable).
- **Support**: Contact/support for “need by date” questions; clear policy and tracking.

### Step 4: Strengthen “why this gift” (post-purchase / share)
- **Gift message**: Optional gift message at checkout.
- **Post-purchase**: “They’re going to love it. Here’s a short note you can share: stress relief and focus in a form that’s actually cool.”
- **Referral**: “Know someone else who’d love one? Share your experience.”

### Step 5: Objection handling (quick ref)
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| “Weird gift” | Stress relief, focus, “something different”; ratings and “thoughtful” framing |
| “Don’t know which type” | Desk/pocket → spinner or slider; subtle → ring or pendant; suggest pendant or Choc as safe |
| “Don’t want to spend much” | Entry options; free ship over $50 |
| “Need by date” | Order with lead time; we ship worldwide; support if issues |
