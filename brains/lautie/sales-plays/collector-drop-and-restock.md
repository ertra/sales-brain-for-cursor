## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- **New drop**: Limited edition or co-brand launch
- **Restock**: Sought-after item back in stock
- **“Coming soon”**: Announcement of future drop (e.g. PEI Mechanic-I, new co-brand)
- **Seasonal**: Mystery Bags, holiday limited editions

### Ideal Signals
- Subscribed to newsletter; follows News
- Previous purchase of limited or flagship item
- Browsing “new arrivals,” “limited,” or specific series/co-brand pages
- Cart abandonment on out-of-stock or high-ticket item (notify when back)

### Qualification (implicit)
| Criteria | Indication |
|----------|------------|
| Intent | Wants specific drop or series; willing to pay premium |
| Engagement | Opens newsletter; clicks “coming soon” or drop links |
| Budget | Often mid–high AOV; may bundle to hit free ship |

## The Play

### Objective
Maximize awareness and conversion for drops and restocks: get collectors into the loop, reduce “I missed it,” and remove friction (e.g. shipping) at checkout.

### Value Proposition for This Play
“Get in early. Stay in the loop with our newsletter and new arrivals so you don’t miss the drops you care about. We ship worldwide with free shipping on orders over $50.”

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Build and use the list
- **Newsletter**: Sign-up on site; “Be the first to know” for drops and restocks
- **News section**: “Coming soon” and drop announcements with clear dates where possible
- **Segmentation**: Tag or segment by interest (e.g. series, co-brands) if data allows

### Step 2: Announce with clarity
- **Subject / headline**: “Just dropped: [Product/Series]”; “Back in stock: [Product]”; “[Co-brand] is here”
- **Content**: Short story (why this drop); link to product; free shipping reminder ($50+); worldwide shipping
- **Urgency**: Limited run or “while stock lasts” only if true; avoid false scarcity

### Step 3: Reduce friction at checkout
- **Free shipping**: Prominent “Free shipping on orders over $50” so international and multi-item orders don’t balk
- **Payment**: Clear options (e.g. PayPal, cards); no surprise fees
- **Support**: Contact for “when will X restock?” or “can I pre-order?” so they feel heard

### Step 4: Post-purchase (collector loyalty)
- **Thank you / order confirm**: “You’re in the club”; “What’s next?” (link to News or next drop)
- **Re-engage**: “Missed this one? Here’s what’s coming” or “Restock alert: [Product]”
- **Community**: Invite to group or fan content (e.g. LAUTIE EDC Facebook Group) if applicable

### Step 5: Objection handling (quick ref)
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| “I always miss drops” | Newsletter + News; we announce so you can plan |
| “Shipping/customs too much” | Free over $50; bundle; worldwide; clear pricing |
| “How do I prioritize?” | Pick a lane: series, co-brands, or flagships; we have a clear universe |
| “Will it hold value?” | Quality + brand + limited/co-brand demand; we don’t control resale |
