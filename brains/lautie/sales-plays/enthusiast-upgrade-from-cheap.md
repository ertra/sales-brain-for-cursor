# Sales Play: Enthusiast Upgrade from Cheap Fidgets

## Play Overview

| | |
|--|--|
| **Play name** | Enthusiast Upgrade from Cheap Fidgets |
| **Target persona** | Fidget & EDC Enthusiast |
| **Target** | Individual who has tried cheap/broken fidgets or wants first premium option |
| **Products** | Fidget Spinners, Fidget Sliders, then optionally Fidget Rings / Pendants |
| **Trigger** | Post-purchase review mention of “upgrade,” “replacement,” “broke”; or inbound from “best fidget” / “premium fidget” search |
| **Play type** | Inbound / lifecycle (post-purchase content, retargeting) |

## When to Run This Play

### Trigger Events
- Visitor or customer mentions previous fidget broke or was unsatisfying
- Search or referral: “premium fidget,” “metal fidget,” “fidget that lasts”
- Review or UGC from someone who “upgraded” from Amazon/generic
- First purchase (slider or spinner)—trigger follow-up for ring/pendant for “meetings and travel”

### Ideal Signals
- Browsing spinner and slider pages; reading reviews
- Cart with one item near free-shipping threshold ($50)
- Returning visitor who didn’t buy (retarget with durability / “upgrade” message)

### Qualification (implicit)
| Criteria | Indication |
|----------|------------|
| Intent | Looking for durable or premium option; or replacing broken fidget |
| Budget | Willing to spend $20–150+ for quality (entry to mid) |
| Use case | Desk/pocket first; possibly interested in discreet later |

## The Play

### Objective
Convert visitors/customers who are ready to move from cheap fidgets to LAUTIE (first purchase or add ring/pendant for discreet use).

### Value Proposition for This Play
“Premium metal, built to last. In-house manufacturing so you’re not replacing it in a few months. And if you ever need something for meetings or travel, we’ve got rings and pendants in the same brand.”

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Capture intent (site / ads / content)
- **Where**: Homepage, category pages, product pages, “why LAUTIE” or “metal vs plastic” content
- **Message**: Durability, in-house QC, “upgrade from cheap”; entry options (Bit-05, Noiz Air-Nano, Choc, Resistor)
- **CTA**: “Find your fidget” / “Shop by category” / “See best sellers”

### Step 2: Reduce friction at consideration
- **Reviews and ratings**: Surface Choc, Mechanic-I, Resistor, Bit-04 Tri ratings
- **Free shipping**: Call out “Free shipping on orders over $50” on cart and product pages
- **Entry tier**: Highlight one or two entry-level products so “premium” isn’t only $100+

### Step 3: Discovery (if human touch—chat, email reply)
**Questions**:
1. “What are you using now for fidgeting, and what’s let you down about it?”
2. “Do you prefer the spin of a spinner or the slide/click of a slider?”
3. “Do you need something you can use in meetings or on the go without it being obvious?”
4. “What’s your budget range—entry level or ready to go mid/flagship?”

**Points to cover**:
- Metal + in-house = durability; no more replacement cycle
- Full lineup: start with spinner or slider; add ring or pendant later if they want discreet
- Entry options so they can try without going flagship

### Step 4: First purchase → expand (lifecycle)
- **Post-purchase email**: “Love your [product]? Add a ring or pendant for meetings and travel—same brand, same quality.”
- **Trigger**: 30–60 days after first purchase; or if they bought only desk/pocket product
- **Offer**: Link to Fidget Rings and Pendants; “best for discreet” short guide

### Step 5: Objection handling (quick ref)
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| “Too expensive” / “Amazon cheaper” | Metal + QC, lasts; entry-level options; cost over time vs. replacing cheap ones |
| “I don’t need another” | Do you have something for meetings/travel? Ring/pendant = discreet |
| “Too much to choose from” | Form first (spinner vs. slider vs. wearable); then best sellers + budget |
