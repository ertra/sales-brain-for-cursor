# Collector & Limited-Edition Buyer - Pain Points

## Overview
Collectors are frustrated by limited runs selling out, unclear drop timing, and international cost/shipping. They want to secure desired pieces, complete series, and feel part of a brand that rewards loyalty.

## Pain Points

### 1. Limited runs sell out before they can buy
- **Description**: Drops and co-brands (PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC, etc.) or limited materials (e.g. PEI Mechanic-I) sell out quickly; missing out feels unfair and fuels FOMO.
- **Impact**: Can’t complete a series or own a desired piece; may pay premium on secondary market or never obtain.
- **Current Solutions**: Follow newsletter and social; set alerts; buy at drop time; sometimes pay resale.
- **Frequency**: Per release (weekly to monthly depending on drop cadence)
- **Severity**: High (core collector frustration)
- **Product Solution**: LAUTIE newsletter and news for announcements; clear “limited” and “new arrival” messaging; Mystery Bags and limited editions as part of lineup.
- **Key Message**: “Get in early. Stay in the loop with our newsletter and new arrivals so you don’t miss the drops you care about.”

### 2. Unclear timing and availability
- **Description**: Hard to know when something will restock or when the next limited run is; “coming soon” isn’t enough to plan or budget.
- **Impact**: Anxiety; missed purchases; can’t plan spending or prioritize which drop to target.
- **Current Solutions**: Check site often; follow community; ask in groups; guess from past patterns.
- **Frequency**: Before each desired purchase or drop
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: News and announcements (e.g. “Limited PEI Mechanic-I — Coming Soon”); newsletter; restock and “out of stock” visibility on site.
- **Key Message**: “We announce what’s coming. Subscribe and check News so you can plan for the pieces you want.”

### 3. International shipping and cost
- **Description**: Collectors outside the main shipping region face higher shipping cost and possible customs; high-ticket items (e.g. Carnival-Mega, Jackpot 2.0) amplify cost and risk.
- **Impact**: Hesitation on big orders; feeling “second class”; sometimes skipping items due to total cost.
- **Current Solutions**: Bundle to justify shipping; use forwarders; buy from local resellers when available.
- **Frequency**: Every international order
- **Severity**: Medium (depends on region and order size)
- **Product Solution**: Worldwide shipping; free shipping over $50 USD; clear pricing in USD; quality packaging (e.g. PELICAN case for premium items).
- **Key Message**: “We ship worldwide. Free shipping on orders over $50—stack a few items or go for the piece you’ve been waiting for.”

### 4. Deciding what to collect with limited budget/space
- **Description**: Many series and co-brands; can’t own everything; need to choose what to prioritize (series completion vs. one-off grails vs. new categories).
- **Impact**: Decision stress; regret if they “waste” budget on the wrong piece; FOMO on what they didn’t buy.
- **Current Solutions**: Set rules (e.g. “only Mechanic,” “only co-brands”); follow community favorites; buy what’s available and trade later.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing as collection grows
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: Clear series and categories (2099, Spy Wars, EDC House, co-brands); variety of price points; strong resale/collector community perception.
- **Key Message**: “Collect your way. Clear series and co-brands so you can focus on what matters to you—and quality that holds value.”

## Pain Point Priority Matrix

| Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Our Solution | Competitive Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Limited runs sell out | High | Per release | Newsletter, news, new arrivals | Transparent drops; community and FOMO used positively |
| Unclear timing/availability | Medium–High | Pre-purchase | News, “coming soon,” newsletter | Reduces surprise; builds planning confidence |
| International shipping/cost | Medium | Every order | Worldwide, free ship $50+ | Removes one barrier for global collectors |
| What to collect (budget/space) | Medium | Ongoing | Series, categories, price range | Clear “universe” to collect within |

## Discovery Questions
1. “Which drops or co-brands have you missed that you wish you hadn’t?”
2. “How do you usually find out about new releases—newsletter, social, or community?”
3. “Are you collecting a specific series or type, or going for grails and one-offs?”
4. “How does shipping or customs affect your decision when you’re buying from us?”

## Trigger Events
- A limited edition or co-brand just dropped or was announced
- Missing a drop and seeing it sold out
- Planning a “big” purchase (flagship or multi-item) and weighing shipping/total cost
- Seeing another collector’s haul or display and wanting to catch up
