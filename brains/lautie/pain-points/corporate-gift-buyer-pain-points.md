# Corporate / Employee Gift Buyer (B2B) - Pain Points

## Overview
Corporate gift buyers need bulk pricing and clear terms, reliable delivery windows (often to many addresses or one event), and a way to match products to a diverse employee audience. They want gifts that feel premium and align with wellness or culture—without a complicated process.

## Pain Points

### 1. No clear bulk or B2B path
- **Description**: Site is D2C; no visible wholesale, volume pricing, or corporate program. Buyers don’t know if they can get a quote, invoice, or dedicated support.
- **Impact**: May not consider LAUTIE for 10–500+ unit orders; default to vendors with obvious B2B options; miss fit for wellness/employee gifts.
- **Current Solutions**: Use contact form or email to ask; order multiple units via standard checkout (small teams); choose other brands with clear B2B.
- **Frequency**: When evaluating vendors for a program or event
- **Severity**: High (gatekeeper for B2B segment)
- **Product Solution**: Opportunity: dedicated B2B/corporate page, contact-for-quote, volume tiers, invoicing. Today: contact form and standard checkout for smaller bulk.
- **Key Message**: “Looking for volume or corporate gifting? Reach out—we can work with you on larger orders and delivery.”

### 2. Delivery windows and distribution
- **Description**: Need gifts by event date or holiday; may need many individual ship-to addresses or one bulk shipment to one location. Lead times and logistics are unclear.
- **Impact**: Can’t commit without knowing if delivery is feasible; risk of late or wrong distribution.
- **Current Solutions**: Order early; use one ship-to and distribute internally; or choose vendors that offer bulk and split shipping.
- **Frequency**: Per program or campaign
- **Severity**: High
- **Product Solution**: Opportunity: defined lead times, bulk ship vs. individual address options. Today: worldwide shipping and support; small teams can order and receive in one shipment.
- **Key Message**: “We ship worldwide. For larger orders we can discuss lead times and how you want delivery—bulk or direct to recipients.”

### 3. Matching product to diverse audience
- **Description**: Employees vary in age, role, and taste; one product must feel appropriate and valuable to most. “Fidget toy” can sound like a kids’ item; need framing (wellness, focus, premium).
- **Impact**: Concern that gifts will be seen as cheap or off-brand; need internal story for stakeholders (HR, leadership).
- **Current Solutions**: Choose “safe” gifts (branded apparel, generic items); test with a small pilot group; look for vendors that provide wellness/culture framing.
- **Frequency**: When designing program
- **Severity**: Medium–High
- **Product Solution**: LAUTIE story (craftsman/designer, in-house, “Stay Cool & Be Different”); stress relief and focus messaging; variety (spinner, slider, ring, pendant) so there can be choice or a “neutral” option (e.g. pendant or slider); premium metal and packaging.
- **Key Message**: “Premium, thoughtful, and on-message. Stress relief and focus in a form that feels grown-up and special—not generic swag.”

### 4. Budget and customization
- **Description**: Need to hit per-unit budget (e.g. $25–50 per person); may want simple customization (gift message, pack-out, or co-brand) to feel “ours.”
- **Impact**: If per-unit cost is too high or customization isn’t available, they switch vendors.
- **Current Solutions**: Set budget and filter vendors; accept no customization for simplicity; or pay premium for custom options elsewhere.
- **Frequency**: Per program
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Product Solution**: LAUTIE has products across price range (entry to flagship); opportunity: volume pricing to hit target per-unit; optional gift message or simple pack-out. Today: standard products and packaging; contact for volume discussion.
- **Key Message**: “We have options from entry to flagship. For volume we can talk pricing and simple customization so it fits your budget and brand.”

## Discovery Questions
1. “How many units are you looking at, and what’s your timeline for delivery?”
2. “Do you need one bulk shipment or delivery to many addresses?”
3. “How do you want to position the gift internally—wellness, focus, recognition, or culture?”
4. “What’s your target per-person budget, and do you need any customization (message, packaging)?”

## Trigger Events
- Planning annual or quarterly employee recognition or wellness initiative
- Need to replace a previous vendor or try something new
- Event (e.g. company anniversary, wellness week) requiring gifts by a date
- Request from leadership for “different” or “premium” employee gifts
