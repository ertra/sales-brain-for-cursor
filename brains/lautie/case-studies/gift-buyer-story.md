# Case Study: Gift Buyer – Thoughtful Gift (Composite)

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer type** | Gift buyer (individual) |
| **Segment** | Colleague/friend gift; wanted “something different” |
| **Products used** | Resistor pendant (primary gift); Storage Pouch (add-on) |
| **Primary persona** | Gift Buyer |
| **Use case** | Thoughtful gift for someone who likes gadgets or stress relief |

## Executive Summary
A buyer looking for a non-generic gift for a colleague who works from home and likes gadgets chose a LAUTIE pendant after seeing categories and reviews. The recipient loved it; the giver had a clear “why this gift” story (stress relief, focus, something different) and stayed within budget with free shipping.

## The Customer (Composite profile)
- **Profile**: Individual gift giver; occasion-driven (birthday / thank-you)
- **Relationship to recipient**: Colleague/friend; recipient has desk job and likes tech and gadgets
- **Context**: Didn’t want another gift card or generic item; budget ~$30–50

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- Wanted to give something memorable but wasn’t sure what
- Worried about “weird” or wrong choice (size, style, interest)
- Needed to stay within budget and have delivery by the occasion
- No clear story for “why this gift” for recipient or for themselves

### Key Pain Points
- Which product type fits (spinner vs. slider vs. ring vs. pendant)?
- Premium feel without overspending
- Reliable delivery by date
- Justifying the choice

### What They Tried Before
- Defaulted to gift cards or generic gifts in the past
- Browsed “unique gifts” and EDC; overwhelmed by options
- Hesitant to buy “a fidget” without understanding the category

## The Solution

### Why They Chose LAUTIE
- Clear shop-by-category (Spinners, Sliders, Rings, Pendants) and use-case messaging (desk, pocket, wearable)
- Resistor highly rated (4.96/5); “best selling” and “thoughtful gift” framing
- Price fit (Resistor in range); free shipping over $50 with add-on pouch
- Stress relief and focus = simple “why this gift” story

### Products Chosen
| Product | Role |
|---------|------|
| Resistor pendant | Main gift; wearable, versatile, highly rated |
| Storage Pouch | Add-on to reach free shipping; made gift feel complete |

### Timeline
- **Discovery**: Search / recommendation → site → categories and reviews
- **Decision**: Pendant chosen as “safe” versatile option (wearable, not desk-only)
- **Delivery**: Ordered with lead time; arrived before occasion

## The Results

### Outcomes

| Outcome | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Right product type | Guess or avoid | Pendant matched “gadget person” and wearable use |
| Premium perception | Risk of “cheap” or random | Metal + design; recipient saw it as thoughtful |
| Delivery | Stress about date | Arrived on time; no issues |
| Story | “Weird” or vague | “Stress relief, focus, something different” |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Recipient loved it; now uses it daily and asked where it’s from
- Giver confident in “thoughtful gift” choice; would buy again for similar occasion
- Recipient may become future LAUTIE customer (conversion from gift)

## Story Quotes (Composite / illustrative)

### On choosing the gift
> "I didn’t want to give another gift card. I wanted something they’d actually use and remember. The pendant made sense—they’re at their desk a lot and like gadgets. And the reviews were really good."

### On the reaction
> "They were surprised in a good way. They said they wouldn’t have thought of it themselves but love it. Now they use it every day."

### On the process
> "The site made it easy—I could see pendants vs. spinners vs. rings and pick something that fit. And hitting free shipping with the pouch was a no-brainer."

## Sales Use

### Best For
- **Persona**: Gift Buyer
- **Use case**: Thoughtful gift for colleague, friend, or family (desk worker, student, gadget lover)
- **Trigger**: Occasion coming up; want “something different”; budget ~$25–80

### Key Talking Points
1. Match form to person: pendant and slider are versatile “safe” choices; categories make it easy.
2. Premium at multiple price points; free shipping over $50 so add-on doesn’t add cost.
3. Stress relief and focus = clear story; recipient reaction is often “wouldn’t have thought of it but love it.”

### Objections This Addresses
- “Weird gift”—frame as stress relief, focus, something different; use ratings and “thoughtful” framing.
- “Don’t know which type”—use categories and “desk vs. pocket vs. wearable”; suggest pendant or Choc as safe bets.
- “Don’t want to spend much”—entry options; free ship over $50.
