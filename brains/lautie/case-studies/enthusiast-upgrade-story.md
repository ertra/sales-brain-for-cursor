# Case Study: Enthusiast Upgrade (Composite)

## Snapshot

| | |
|--|--|
| **Customer type** | Fidget & EDC enthusiast (individual) |
| **Segment** | Upgrader from cheap/broken fidgets |
| **Products used** | Fidget Slider (Choc), then Fidget Ring (Mechanic-I) |
| **Primary persona** | Fidget & EDC Enthusiast |
| **Use case** | Desk and pocket fidget; then discreet fidget in meetings |

## Executive Summary
A desk worker who had gone through several cheap fidget spinners switched to LAUTIE for a durable slider and later added a ring for meetings. The result: one brand for desk, pocket, and wearable use; no more replacements; and consistent tactile quality that supports focus and stress relief.

## The Customer (Composite profile)
- **Profile**: Individual buyer; desk job with frequent calls and some travel
- **Location**: International (shipped worldwide)
- **Context**: Uses fidgets for focus and stress relief; had tried generic options first

## The Challenge

### Situation Before
- Used cheap plastic and low-grade metal spinners from Amazon or big-box stores
- Products broke, lost spin, or felt inconsistent within weeks or months
- No option for meetings or travel—desk spinner not appropriate; went without or used pen clicking
- Felt “burned” by premium claims from other brands that didn’t last

### Key Pain Points
- Cheap fidgets don’t last; repeated replacement cost and frustration
- No discreet or wearable option for calls and meetings
- Unclear which premium brand to trust

### What They Tried Before
- Multiple budget spinners (plastic and basic metal)
- One “mid-tier” brand that still failed within a few months
- Going without fidget in meetings

## The Solution

### Why They Chose LAUTIE
- In-house manufacturing and metal construction as a durability signal
- Strong reviews (e.g. Choc, Mechanic-I) to reduce purchase risk
- Full lineup: could start with a slider and add a ring later without switching brands
- Clear categories and price range (entry to flagship)

### Products Implemented
| Product | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Choc mechanical slider | Desk and pocket; primary daily fidget |
| Mechanic-I ring | Meetings, calls, travel; worn daily |

### Timeline
- **First purchase**: Slider after reading reviews and “in-house” story
- **Second purchase**: Ring a few months later when they wanted a discreet option
- **Time to value**: Immediate (satisfaction and durability from first use)

## The Results

### Outcomes (Before vs. After)

| Outcome | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Durability | Replace every few months | One slider + one ring; both still in use |
| Use contexts | Desk only | Desk, pocket, meetings, travel |
| Spend over time | Repeated $10–20 replacements | Upfront on two quality pieces; no replacement cycle |
| Consistency | Hit or miss feel | Same satisfying feel every time |

### Qualitative Benefits
- Reliable stress relief and focus at desk and on calls
- No more “can’t fidget here”; ring is always available
- Single brand to recommend to others; has referred friends

## Story Quotes (Composite / illustrative)

### On switching from cheap fidgets
> "I got tired of buying something that broke or felt wrong in a month. I wanted metal and something that would actually last. The Choc was the first one that lived up to it."

### On adding the ring
> "I couldn’t use a spinner on calls. The ring changed that—I can fidget without anyone noticing. Same brand, same quality, just wearable."

### On brand fit
> "I like that it’s not generic. The ‘Stay Cool & Be Different’ thing and the fact they make it in-house—it actually feels like a brand I want to stick with."

## Sales Use

### Best For
- **Persona**: Fidget & EDC Enthusiast
- **Use case**: Desk and pocket fidget; discreet fidget in meetings/travel
- **Trigger**: Burned by cheap fidgets; need discreet option; “which premium brand?”

### Key Talking Points
1. Upgrade from cheap to metal and in-house QC = no more replacement cycle.
2. One brand for desk, pocket, and wearable—slider + ring covers all contexts.
3. Strong reviews (Choc, Mechanic-I) reduce risk of trying LAUTIE.

### Objections This Addresses
- “Too expensive” / “Amazon is cheaper”—durability and one-time spend vs. repeated replacement.
- “I don’t need another fidget”—discreet option (ring/pendant) for meetings and travel.
- “Which brand do I trust?”—in-house manufacturing and ratings.
