## Responsibilities
- Personal use: stress relief, focus, tactile satisfaction during work or downtime

- Stays informed on new releases and product lines

## Company Profile
N/A (B2C). Buys for self; often repeat customer. May work in any job or industry; uses fidgets at desk, in meetings, or on the go.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Cheap fidgets break or feel unsatisfying; want durable, premium metal options
- Need discreet or wearable options (e.g. rings, pendants) for office or public use
- Overwhelmed by many SKUs, series (Noiz, Bit, Choc, Mechanic), and price points; need guidance on “what to buy first”

## Goals & Objectives
- Reliable, satisfying fidget experience (spin, slide, click) that lasts
- Products that match identity (“Stay Cool & Be Different”) and EDC aesthetic
- Option to grow collection or try new categories (sliders, rings, pendants) with confidence in quality

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems

- **Clear series and categories** (Fidget Spinners, Sliders, Rings, Pendants, EDC/DIY accessories) plus reviews and community help narrow choices; entry to flagship price range ($5–$600) suits different budgets

## Buying Process
- Researches online (site, reviews, community); may discover via EDC/fidget content or word of mouth
- Often buys direct from lautie.com; considers free shipping threshold ($50), variant options, and ratings
- Repeat purchases for new releases, different product types, or backups

## Communication Preferences
- Website and product pages; clear specs, materials, and price ranges
- Newsletter and news for new arrivals and limited editions
- Community (Facebook Group, fan photos) for social proof and recommendations

## Additional Notes
- Primary D2C segment; strong repeat and advocate potential. “Hot sale” and “new arrivals” messaging resonates.
