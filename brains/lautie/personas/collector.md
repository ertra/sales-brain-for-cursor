# Collector & Limited-Edition Buyer

## Role/Title
Individual consumer; collector of premium EDC / fidget / limited editions

## Responsibilities
- Tracks releases, co-brands, and flagship drops
- May complete series, display pieces, or resell; values rarity and story
- Willing to pay premium for limited runs and special collaborations

## Company Profile
N/A (B2C). Buys for collection or resale; sometimes multi-unit orders (variants, different materials). Engaged in collector and EDC communities.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Limited runs sell out; need to know drop timing and availability
- International shipping and cost for higher-ticket items
- Deciding which co-brands or flagships to prioritize (budget and space)

## Goals & Objectives
- Secure desired limited editions, co-brands (PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC, OneBean), and flagship items (e.g. Jackpot 2.0, Carnival-Mega)
- Maintain or grow collection with consistent quality and brand reputation
- Feel part of a brand with strong design and craftsmanship story

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **LAUTIE** regularly releases limited editions and co-brands with clear branding and quality; in-house manufacturing supports consistent build
- **News and newsletter** signal new drops and restocks
- **Worldwide shipping** and clear pricing (USD) support international collectors; free shipping over $50 helps multi-item orders
- **Series and lineup** (2099, Spy Wars, EDC House, etc.) give a clear “universe” to collect

## Buying Process
- Monitors news, newsletter, and community for announcements
- Buys quickly on release when items are limited; may buy multiple variants or materials
- Values authenticity, packaging, and condition; may use protective cases (e.g. PELICAN) for display or storage

## Communication Preferences
- Early or exclusive access to drop info; clear “limited” and “co-brand” messaging
- Product stories (craftsman/designer, in-house factory) and series lore
- Community and fan photos for validation and FOMO

## Additional Notes
- High AOV potential; sensitive to availability and timing. Mystery bags and limited PEI/special materials appeal to this persona.
