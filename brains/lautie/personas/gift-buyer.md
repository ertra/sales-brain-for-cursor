# Gift Buyer

## Role/Title
Individual or small-bulk buyer; purchasing for someone else (occasion gift, team gift, thank-you)

## Responsibilities
- Finding a memorable, appropriate gift for recipient(s)
- Matching budget, occasion, and delivery timeline
- May not be familiar with fidget/EDC products; needs clear guidance

## Company Profile
N/A (B2C) or small team/group. Buys 1–10+ units; occasion-driven (birthday, holiday, promotion, wellness/thank-you). Recipients may be colleagues, friends, family, or employees.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Unsure which product type fits (spinner vs. slider vs. ring vs. pendant)
- Balancing budget with “premium” feel; avoiding generic or cheap-looking gifts
- Need delivery by a specific date; international or domestic shipping clarity

## Goals & Objectives
- Gift that feels thoughtful, unique, and quality (not generic)
- Easy selection (categories, price ranges, “best for” guidance)
- Reliable delivery and, if needed, gift-ready packaging or messaging

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **LAUTIE** offers a clear **shop by category** (Fidget Spinners, Sliders, Rings, Pendants, EDC/DIY) and **price ranges** from ~$1–$600 so gift buyers can match budget and form factor
- **Premium metal and design** (“Stay Cool & Be Different”) support “special gift” positioning; **reviews and ratings** provide social proof
- **Free shipping on orders over $50** reduces friction for multi-item or higher-ticket gifts; **worldwide shipping** supports international recipients
- **Product names and series** (e.g. Choc, Mechanic-I, Resistor) make gifts easy to describe and remember

## Buying Process
- Browses by category or price; may search “gift” or “stress relief” / “focus”
- Reads short descriptions and ratings; may ask recipient’s preference (fidget type) if possible
- Checks shipping and delivery; may bundle to hit free shipping

## Communication Preferences
- Clear “best for gifting” or “popular” cues; price filters and category labels
- Testimonials or use cases (stress relief, focus, desk toy) that justify the gift
- Simple checkout and delivery info; optional gift message or packaging

## Additional Notes
- Seasonal peaks (holidays, Valentine’s, etc.); “add to order notes” promos (e.g. seasonal patch) can increase perceived value. Gift buyers often convert to enthusiasts if recipient loves the product.
