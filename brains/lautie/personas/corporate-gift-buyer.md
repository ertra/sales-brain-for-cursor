# Corporate / Employee Gift Buyer (B2B)

## Role/Title
HR, People/Culture, Wellness, or Procurement; responsible for employee recognition, wellness initiatives, or event/thank-you gifts

## Responsibilities
- Sourcing distinctive, on-brand gifts for employees or events (10–500+ units)
- Aligning with wellness, focus, or “we care” messaging
- Managing budget, lead times, and delivery (often to many addresses or one bulk shipment)

## Company Profile
Any industry; company size from small (10–50) to mid/large (100+). Often values “not another logo mug”; seeks memorable, premium-feel items that support wellbeing or productivity narrative.

## Key Problems & Pain Points
- Bulk pricing and minimums; need clear B2B or volume options
- Delivery windows (e.g. by event date or holiday); possible international distribution
- Matching product to audience (office workers, remote, mixed) and explaining “why fidget” to stakeholders

## Goals & Objectives
- Gifts that feel premium and thoughtful; support stress-relief, focus, or wellness story
- Simple process: pricing, ordering, delivery; optional customization (packaging, message)
- Positive employee reaction and alignment with company values

## How Our Products Solve Their Problems
- **LAUTIE** offers a **broad price range** and **product variety** (spinners, sliders, rings, pendants) so corporate buyers can choose by budget and form factor; **stress-relief and focus** messaging fits wellness/engagement themes
- **Brand story** (craftsman/designer, in-house manufacturing) supports “quality and care” narrative
- **Worldwide shipping** and **clear product info** help with multi-country or remote teams
- **No public B2B portal today**; opportunity for dedicated bulk/quote process, delivery options, and simple customization (e.g. gift message, pack-out)

## Buying Process
- Researches “employee gifts,” “wellness gifts,” or “premium fidget”; may find LAUTIE via search or recommendation
- Needs quote or bulk pricing; may contact via contact form or email
- Requires clear lead time, delivery options (bulk vs. individual), and invoicing/payment terms

## Communication Preferences
- Dedicated B2B/corporate page or contact path; case studies or testimonials from other companies (if available)
- One-pager: product options, volume tiers, lead times, delivery
- Responsive sales or support for quotes and custom requests

## Additional Notes
- **Potential segment**; site is D2C-focused. Building this persona supports future wholesale, corporate gifting program, or partner channel. For now, small teams may order multiple units via standard checkout.
