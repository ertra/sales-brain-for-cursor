# Fidget & EDC Enthusiast - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from the Fidget & EDC Enthusiast persona and how to handle them. Focus: durability vs. cheap options, discreet/wearable need, choice overload, and identity fit.

## Objections

### 1. Price: "I can get something on Amazon for $10"

**Why They Say This**: Comparing on price only; may not have had a cheap one fail yet, or budget is tight.

**Acknowledge**: "I get it—there are cheaper options, and price is real."

**Respond**: "The difference is whether it lasts and whether it actually feels good. Ours are metal and made in-house with real QC, so you’re not replacing them in a few months. A lot of people come to us after a cheap one broke or felt wrong. We also have entry-level options—Bit-05, Noiz Air-Nano, Resistor—so you don’t have to go flagship to get that quality."

**Proof Point**: In-house manufacturing; Choc 4.88/5, Mechanic-I 4.89/5; entry-tier products from ~$5–$30.

**Follow-Up Question**: "What are you using now, and how long has it lasted?"

---

### 2. Need: "I don’t need another fidget / I’m fine with what I have"

**Why They Say This**: Already own something; don’t see a reason to add or switch.

**Acknowledge**: "If what you have works for you, that’s valid."

**Respond**: "Two things: Do you have something you can use in meetings or when you’re out—like a ring or pendant? A lot of people have a desk spinner but want something discreet. And when what you have does eventually die, we’re here with metal and real build quality so the next one lasts. So even if you’re not replacing today, it’s worth knowing we’re an option."

**Proof Point**: Mechanic rings, Resistor/Capsule pendants for discreet use; metal + QC for longevity.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Where do you use it most—desk only, or on calls and when you’re out too?"

---

### 3. Choice: "There’s too much to choose from"

**Why They Say This**: Overwhelmed by series (Noiz, Bit, Choc, Mechanic, etc.) and price range.

**Acknowledge**: "We do have a lot of options—that’s the upside, but it can feel like a lot."

**Respond**: "Start with form factor: spinner or slider for desk/pocket, or ring/pendant if you want something wearable. Then use ‘best selling’ and reviews—Choc, Mechanic-I, Resistor are all highly rated. And we’ve got entry to flagship, so you can pick a price band and then choose within it. What do you prefer—spin or slide—and what’s your budget range?"

**Proof Point**: Clear categories; best sellers and ratings; entry to flagship ($5–$600).

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do you prefer the spin of a spinner or the slide/click of a slider?"

---

### 4. Identity: "I’m not sure I’m a ‘fidget person’"

**Why They Say This**: Don’t identify with the label or haven’t tried quality fidgets.

**Acknowledge**: "Not everyone thinks of themselves that way."

**Respond**: "A lot of people use them for focus or stress without calling it fidgeting—something to do with your hands on calls or when thinking. We’ve got options that don’t look like toys: rings and pendants that look like normal EDC or jewelry. So it’s less about the label and more about whether you want something tactile that lasts. Want me to point you to one or two that fit that?"

**Proof Point**: Mechanic rings, pendants; “Stay Cool & Be Different”; community and brand story.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do you ever find yourself playing with a pen or something on calls?"

---

### 5. Competition: "I’m looking at [other brand] too"

**Why They Say This**: Comparing options; may have loyalty or found them first.

**Acknowledge**: "Makes sense to look at a few options."

**Respond**: "What matters most to you—one great spinner, or the option to add a ring or pendant later for meetings and travel? We do spinners, sliders, rings, and pendants in one brand, so you can stay in one ecosystem. And we’ve got clear series and co-brands if you’re into collecting. What do you like about the other option?"

**Proof Point**: Full lineup; series (2099, Spy Wars, EDC House); co-brands (PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC).

**Follow-Up Question**: "What would make you choose us over them?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "What are you using now for fidgeting, and what’s let you down about it?"
2. "Do you need something you can use in meetings or on the go without it being obvious?"
3. "Do you prefer spin (spinner) or slide/click (slider)?"
4. "What’s your budget range—entry level or ready to go mid/flagship?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Only talking about price without mentioning durability or use case
- No interest in rings/pendants when they mention meetings or travel
- "I’ll think about it" with no specific concern—dig for real objection
