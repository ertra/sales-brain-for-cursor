# Collector & Limited-Edition Buyer - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from the Collector persona and how to handle them. Focus: missing drops, timing/availability, international shipping and cost, and prioritizing what to collect.

## Objections

### 1. Timing: "I always miss the drops" / "I never know when things restock"

**Why They Say This**: FOMO; lack of clear communication on drops and restocks.

**Acknowledge**: "Missing a drop you wanted is really frustrating."

**Respond**: "The best way to not miss is our newsletter and the News section on the site—we announce coming soon and drops there so you can plan. Once you’re on the list, you’re in the loop. And we ship worldwide with free shipping over fifty, so when something does drop, you’re not dealing with surprise shipping cost on top."

**Proof Point**: Newsletter; News/“coming soon”; free ship $50+; worldwide shipping.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Are you on our newsletter? Which series or co-brands are you most into?"

---

### 2. Cost: "Shipping / customs is too much for me"

**Why They Say This**: International cost or hassle; high-ticket items amplify total cost.

**Acknowledge**: "Shipping and customs can add up, especially on big orders."

**Respond**: "We ship worldwide and do free shipping on orders over fifty dollars, so stacking a few items or adding an accessory often gets you there. If you’re going for one high-ticket item, the total might still be less than you’d pay resale. Where are you based? I can keep that in mind when we talk options."

**Proof Point**: Worldwide shipping; free over $50; clear USD pricing; quality packaging (e.g. PELICAN case for premium).

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do you usually order single pieces or bundle to hit free shipping?"

---

### 3. Choice: "I can’t collect everything—how do I prioritize?"

**Why They Say This**: Limited budget or space; many series and co-brands; FOMO on what they don’t buy.

**Acknowledge**: "There’s a lot to want—prioritizing is hard."

**Respond**: "A lot of collectors pick a lane: one series (e.g. Mechanic), co-brands only, or flagships like Jackpot or Carnival-Mega. We’ve got a clear universe—2099, Spy Wars, EDC House, plus collabs like PELICAN and DZ—so you can focus on what matters to you. Quality is consistent across the line, so whatever you choose holds value."

**Proof Point**: Series and co-brands; in-house QC; strong resale/collector perception.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Are you more into completing a series or going for grails and one-offs?"

---

### 4. Competition: "I get my limited stuff from [other brand]"

**Why They Say This**: Loyalty to another brand’s drops or community.

**Acknowledge**: "Makes sense if you’re already deep in another brand."

**Respond**: "We’re not asking you to choose one—a lot of people collect across brands. What we do offer is a full lineup and clear series under one roof: spinners, sliders, rings, pendants, plus co-brands like PELICAN and DZ. So if you ever want to add LAUTIE to the mix—or switch when a drop lines up—you’ve got a full universe here. What do you like most about the other brand?"

**Proof Point**: Full lineup; multiple co-brands; series (2099, Spy Wars, EDC House); newsletter and News for drops.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Which of our series or co-brands would you be most interested in if the timing was right?"

---

### 5. Trust: "How do I know it’ll hold value?" / "What if I need to resell?"

**Why They Say This**: Collecting or resale mindset; want to minimize risk.

**Acknowledge**: "Collectors think about that—totally valid."

**Respond**: "We’re known for consistent quality and in-house manufacturing, and our series and co-brands have a clear following. We don’t control the resale market, but the brand and build quality support the idea that pieces hold value. Limited runs and co-brands tend to have the most demand. What are you most focused on—personal collection or potential resale?"

**Proof Point**: In-house QC; brand reputation; limited editions and co-brands; community (e.g. Facebook Group).

**Follow-Up Question**: "Are you collecting for yourself or partly with resale in mind?"

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "Which drops or co-brands have you missed that you wish you hadn’t?"
2. "How do you usually find out about new releases—newsletter, social, or community?"
3. "Are you collecting a specific series or type, or going for grails and one-offs?"
4. "How does shipping or customs affect your decision when buying from us?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Not on newsletter but complains about missing drops—get them subscribed
- Only talks about resale—clarify collecting vs. flipping; we don’t guarantee resale
- International and never ordered—address shipping/customs up front
