# Gift Buyer - Objection Handling

## Overview
Common objections from the Gift Buyer persona and how to handle them. Focus: "weird" gift, which type to choose, budget vs. premium feel, and delivery.

## Objections

### 1. Fit: "I don’t know if they’d like a fidget" / "Isn’t that a weird gift?"

**Why They Say This**: Worry it’s too niche or that the recipient won’t get it.

**Acknowledge**: "It can feel like a left-field choice if you’ve never given one."

**Respond**: "It works when you frame it as stress relief or focus—something for their desk or pocket, or a ring or pendant they can wear. We’ve got options from low to higher price so it can feel like a real gift, not a gag. The reaction we hear is usually ‘I wouldn’t have thought of it but I love it.’ What’s the person like—desk job, student, always on the go?"

**Proof Point**: Use-case messaging on site; ratings (Resistor 4.96/5, Choc 4.88/5); “thoughtful gift” positioning.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Do they like gadgets or trying new stuff? What’s your budget for the gift?"

---

### 2. Choice: "I don’t know which type to get—spinner, slider, ring, or pendant"

**Why They Say This**: Overwhelmed by choice; don’t know recipient’s preference.

**Acknowledge**: "There are a lot of options, so it’s normal to hesitate."

**Respond**: "Think about how they’d use it. Desk or pocket? Then spinner or slider. Want it subtle—meetings, travel? Then ring or pendant. We have ‘best selling’ and clear categories so you can pick by form. If you’re not sure, a pendant or a well-rated slider like the Choc is a safe bet—they’re versatile and look intentional, not like a toy."

**Proof Point**: Shop by category; best sellers (Choc, Resistor, Mechanic-I); use-case descriptions.

**Follow-Up Question**: "What’s their style—more low-key or into gadgets and gear?"

---

### 3. Price: "I don’t want to spend that much on a gift"

**Why They Say This**: Budget constraint; may not see fidget as worth a higher spend.

**Acknowledge**: "Totally fair to have a number in mind."

**Respond**: "We have options from about five dollars up—Resistor pendant, Bit-05 spinner—so you can get metal and our quality without going high. And once you’re in the fifty-dollar range, shipping’s free, so adding a pouch or a second item doesn’t add cost. What’s the range you’re comfortable with?"

**Proof Point**: Free shipping over $50; entry-tier gifts (Resistor, Bit-05, Noiz Air-Nano); same quality story at every tier.

**Follow-Up Question**: "Are you looking for one main gift or a few smaller ones?"

---

### 4. Delivery: "I need it by [date]—can you get it there?"

**Why They Say This**: Time-sensitive occasion; fear of late or lost delivery.

**Acknowledge**: "Making sure it gets there on time is important."

**Respond**: "We ship worldwide and stand behind delivery. Order with enough lead time for your region—if you’re unsure, order earlier rather than last minute. If something goes wrong, our support can help. What’s the occasion and when do you need it by?"

**Proof Point**: Worldwide shipping; clear shipping info on site; contact/support for issues.

**Follow-Up Question**: "What’s your delivery address and the date you need it by? I can point you to our shipping info so you can plan."

---

### 5. Status quo: "I’ll just get a gift card" / "I always do [other gift]"

**Why They Say This**: Default to safe option; avoid risk of wrong choice.

**Acknowledge**: "Gift cards are easy, and lots of people do that."

**Respond**: "If you want something that feels more thoughtful, this is a way to do it without guessing their size or taste. You’re picking the category—desk, pocket, or wearable—and the quality does the rest. And we’ve got a range of prices so you can match what you’d usually spend. What do you normally spend on a gift for them?"

**Proof Point**: Categories reduce “wrong choice” risk; premium feel at multiple price points; stress relief/focus = easy story.

**Follow-Up Question**: "What’s the occasion? That can help narrow the best form and price."

## Objection Prevention

### Questions to Ask Early
1. "Who’s the gift for, and do you know if they like gadgets or fidgeting?"
2. "Do you have a budget and a date it needs to arrive by?"
3. "Would they prefer something for the desk, for the pocket, or something they can wear?"
4. "What’s the occasion?"

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Vague “I’ll look” with no occasion or budget—ask for occasion and range
- Only focused on price with no interest in “thoughtful” or “different”—emphasize story and categories
- Last-minute order with tight date—set expectation on lead time and suggest ordering early next time

| Need by date | Order with lead time; we ship worldwide and support issues | Shipping info; support |
