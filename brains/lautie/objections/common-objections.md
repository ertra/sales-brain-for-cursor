# Common Objections & Responses

## Price / Budget

### "It's too expensive" / "I can get one on Amazon for way less"

**Why they say this**: Comparing only on price; may not yet value durability, feel, or brand; or had a bad experience with “premium” that wasn’t worth it.

**Acknowledge**: "I get it—price is real, and there are cheaper options out there."

**Respond**: "The difference is whether it lasts and whether it actually feels good. Ours are metal and made in-house with real quality control, so you’re not replacing them in a few months. A lot of people come to us after a cheap one broke or felt wrong. We also have entry-level options—like the Bit-05 or Resistor—so you don’t have to go flagship to get that quality."

**Proof**: In-house manufacturing, QC; ratings (e.g. Choc 4.88/5, Mechanic-I 4.89/5); entry to flagship price range ($5–$600).

**Follow-up**: "What are you using now, and how long has it lasted? Have you had one break or stop satisfying you?"

---

### "I don’t want to spend that much on a fidget"

**Why they say this**: Budget constraint or don’t see fidget as worth a higher spend.

**Acknowledge**: "Totally fair to have a number in mind."

**Respond**: "We have options from about five dollars up—things like the Resistor pendant or Bit-05 spinner—so you can get metal and our quality without going high. And once you’re in the fifty-dollar range, shipping’s free, so adding a pouch or a second item doesn’t add cost. What’s the range you’re comfortable with?"

**Proof**: Free shipping over $50; entry-tier products (Bit-05, Noiz Air-Nano, Resistor, etc.); same brand/QC at every tier.

**Follow-up**: "Are you looking for one main piece or something to try a few types?"

---

## Competition / Alternatives

### "I’m looking at [other brand] too" / "I’ve seen similar stuff elsewhere"

**Why they say this**: Comparing options; may have loyalty to another brand or found them first.

**Acknowledge**: "Makes sense to look at a few options."

**Respond**: "What are you looking for—just spinners, or also something you could use in meetings or on the go? We do spinners, sliders, rings, and pendants in one brand, so if you ever want a ring or pendant for discreet fidgeting, you’re already in the same ecosystem. And we’ve got clear series and co-brands—PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC—if you’re into collecting. What matters most to you: one great spinner, or having the option to add a ring or pendant later?"

**Proof**: Full lineup (spinners, sliders, rings, pendants); series and co-brands; in-house story.

**Follow-up**: "What do you like about the other option? What would make you choose us?"

---

### "Amazon has tons of options for less"

**Why they say this**: Convenience and price; may not have been burned by cheap ones yet.

**Acknowledge**: "Yeah, there’s a lot on Amazon."

**Respond**: "The tradeoff is durability and feel. Ours are metal and made in-house—we control the quality so they last and feel consistent. If you’ve had a cheap one break or feel wrong, that’s exactly who we’re for. If you’re just trying fidgeting for the first time, we’ve got entry-level pieces so you’re not gambling on a random Amazon buy."

**Proof**: In-house manufacturing; ratings; entry-level options.

**Follow-up**: "Have you tried a fidget before—spinner or slider—and what happened to it?"

---

## Need / Status Quo

### "I don’t need another fidget" / "I’m fine with what I have"

**Why they say this**: Already have something; don’t see a reason to switch or add.

**Acknowledge**: "If what you have works, that’s valid."

**Respond**: "A couple of things: Do you have something you can use in meetings or when you’re out—like a ring or pendant? A lot of people have a desk spinner but want something discreet. And if what you have is plastic or cheap metal, the upgrade is really about it lasting and feeling the same every time. So even if you’re not replacing it today, when it does die, we’re here with metal and a real warranty on the build."

**Proof**: Rings and pendants for discreet use; metal + QC for longevity.

**Follow-up**: "Where do you use it most—desk only, or also on calls or when you’re out?"

---

### "I’m not sure I’m a ‘fidget person’"

**Why they say this**: Don’t identify with the label or haven’t tried quality fidgets.

**Acknowledge**: "Not everyone thinks of themselves that way."

**Respond**: "A lot of people use them for focus or stress without calling it fidgeting—like something to do with your hands on calls or when you’re thinking. We’ve got options that don’t look like toys: rings and pendants that look like normal EDC or jewelry. So it’s less about the label and more about whether you want something tactile that lasts. Want me to point you to one or two that fit that?"

**Proof**: Mechanic rings, Resistor/Capsule/Pointer pendants; “Stay Cool & Be Different” positioning.

**Follow-up**: "Do you ever find yourself playing with a pen or something on calls? That’s the same idea, just built for it."

---

## Gift-Specific

### "I don’t know if they’d like a fidget" / "Isn’t that a weird gift?"

**Why they say this**: Worry it’s too niche or that recipient won’t get it.

**Acknowledge**: "It can feel like a left-field choice if you’ve never given one."

**Respond**: "It works when you frame it as stress relief or focus—something for their desk or pocket, or a ring or pendant they can wear. We’ve got options from low to higher price so it can feel like a real gift, not a gag. And the reaction we hear is usually ‘I wouldn’t have thought of it but I love it.’ What’s the person like—desk job, student, always on the go?"

**Proof**: Categories and use cases on site; ratings; “thoughtful gift” positioning.

**Follow-up**: "Do they like gadgets or trying new stuff? What’s your budget for the gift?"

---

### "I don’t know which type to get—spinner, slider, ring, or pendant"

**Why they say this**: Overwhelmed by choice; don’t know recipient’s preference.

**Acknowledge**: "There are a lot of options, so it’s normal to hesitate."

**Respond**: "Think about how they’d use it. Desk or pocket? Then spinner or slider. Want it subtle—meetings, travel? Then ring or pendant. We have a ‘best selling’ and clear categories so you can pick by form. If you’re not sure, a pendant or a well-rated slider like the Choc is a safe bet—they’re versatile and look intentional, not like a toy."

**Proof**: Shop by category; best sellers (Choc, Resistor, Mechanic-I, etc.); use-case messaging.

**Follow-up**: "What’s their style—more low-key or into gadgets and gear?"

---

## Collector-Specific

### "I always miss the drops" / "I never know when things restock"

**Why they say this**: FOMO; lack of clear timing.

**Acknowledge**: "Missing a drop you wanted is frustrating."

**Respond**: "The best way to not miss is our newsletter and the News section on the site—we announce coming soon and drops there. So you can plan and be ready. And we ship worldwide with free shipping over fifty, so when something does drop, you’re not dealing with surprise shipping cost on top."

**Proof**: Newsletter; News/“coming soon”; free ship $50+; worldwide shipping.

**Follow-up**: "Are you on our newsletter? Which series or co-brands are you most into?"

---

### "Shipping / customs is too much for me"

**Why they say this**: International cost or hassle.

**Acknowledge**: "Shipping and customs can add up, especially on big orders."

**Respond**: "We ship worldwide and do free shipping on orders over fifty dollars, so stacking a few items or adding an accessory often gets you there. If you’re going for one high-ticket item, the total might still be less than you’d pay resale. Where are you based? I can keep that in mind when we talk options."

**Proof**: Worldwide shipping; free over $50; clear USD pricing.

**Follow-up**: "Do you usually order single pieces or bundle to hit free shipping?"
