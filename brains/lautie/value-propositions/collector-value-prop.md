# LAUTIE Full Line → Collector & Limited-Edition Buyer Value Proposition

## Summary
For the collector, LAUTIE delivers a coherent “universe” of series and co-brands (2099, Spy Wars, EDC House, PELICAN, DZ, UrbanEDC, OneBean) with consistent quality and in-house manufacturing. Newsletter and news reduce missed drops; worldwide shipping and free ship over $50 remove friction for international and multi-item orders—so they can collect with confidence and stay part of the brand.

## The Problem
- Limited runs and co-brands sell out; missing a drop feels unfair and fuels FOMO.
- Unclear when things restock or drop; hard to plan and budget.
- International shipping and cost add friction, especially on high-ticket items.
- Many series and co-brands; need to prioritize what to collect (budget/space).

## The Solution
- **Newsletter and news** for drop and restock announcements; “new arrivals” and “limited” messaging.
- **Worldwide shipping and free shipping over $50** so global collectors can order without extra hesitation; quality packaging (e.g. PELICAN case) for premium pieces.
- **Clear series and categories** so they can collect by theme (e.g. Mechanic, 2099, co-brands) and feel the lineup has structure and value.
