# Common Objections & Responses

## Pricing & Budget Objections

### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: 
"I understand budget is a consideration. Let me share some context: Our customers see an average 236% ROI over three years, and Wrike saved $350K by consolidating tools onto Salesloft. What tools are you currently using that might be consolidated? Often, the math works in your favor when you look at total cost of ownership."

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "What are you currently spending on sales technology?"
- "How many different tools does your team use today?"
- "What would it be worth to improve win rates by 12%?"

---

### "We don't have budget right now"
**Response**:
"I hear that. A few questions: Is the budget issue timing or total dollars? And what's the cost of not solving [their pain point] for another quarter? We've helped companies build business cases that got budget approved because the ROI is so clear. Would it help if I shared how other customers justified the investment?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "When does your next budget cycle begin?"
- "What would need to be true for this to become a priority?"
- "Is there discretionary budget or year-end funds available?"

## Competition Objections

### "We already use Outreach/Gong/Clari"
**Response**:
"Many of our best customers came from [competitor]. The main reasons they switched were [relevant differentiator]. But rather than me telling you why we're different, what made you take this meeting? What's not working with your current solution?"

**Key Differentiators to Highlight**:
- vs. Outreach: Drift chat, more AI agents, unified platform
- vs. Gong: Full engagement platform, not just CI
- vs. Clari: Engagement + forecasting together

### "We're happy with our current tools"
**Response**:
"That's great that things are working. I'm curious - are you hitting your revenue goals consistently? Is your forecast accuracy where you want it? Our best customers weren't necessarily unhappy before, they just discovered they could perform even better. What does 'good enough' look like for you?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "We're not ready to make a change right now"
**Response**:
"I understand timing matters. What would need to change for you to be ready? Is it a specific milestone, initiative, or event? Many customers start with just one use case and expand over time. What's the one thing that, if we could solve it, would make this worth exploring sooner?"

---

### "We just implemented [other tool]"
**Response**:
"Congratulations on getting that live. How's it going? [Listen]. Interestingly, Salesloft integrates with [tool] and many customers use us alongside it before eventually consolidating. Would it be worth seeing how we could complement what you just implemented?"

---

## Technical/Fit Objections

### "We need to check with IT/Security first"
**Response**:
"Absolutely, and we want them involved. We have a dedicated Trust Center and work with enterprise security teams daily. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and GDPR ready. Can I connect our team with yours to address any specific requirements?"

**Resources**:
- Trust Center: trust.salesloft.com
- Security documentation available
- Dedicated security review process

---

### "Will this integrate with our CRM?"
**Response**:
"Which CRM are you using? [Salesforce/HubSpot/Dynamics]. Great - we have native, bi-directional integration that's no-code to set up. Activity syncs automatically, deals stay updated, and your CRM remains the source of truth. Would you like to see the integration in action?"

---

### "Our sales process is unique"
**Response**:
"Every company says that, and honestly, every company is right to some degree. The good news is Salesloft is highly configurable - we support custom sales methodologies like MEDDPICC, BANT, and custom frameworks. We work with everything from transactional to complex enterprise sales. What's unique about your process?"

---

## Value/Need Objections

### "My reps are already productive"
**Response**:
"That's great - productive reps are the foundation. But here's what we see: even top-performing teams leave money on the table. Our customers see 12% higher win rates and 2.5x faster deal cycles. If your reps are already good, imagine what they could do with AI agents handling their research and prioritizing their best opportunities. Would a 12% improvement be meaningful?"

---

### "We tried sales engagement before and it didn't work"
**Response**:
"I hear that, and I'm sorry that happened. Can I ask what tool you used and what went wrong? [Listen]. That's helpful context. Salesloft is specifically designed to be adopted by sellers - it makes their job easier, not harder. We have the industry's fastest time to value, with results in the first 10 days. What would make you confident this time would be different?"

---

### "I don't see the ROI"
**Response**:
"Let's build the business case together. Forrester conducted an independent study showing 236% ROI over three years. But let me ask: What's one qualified meeting worth to your company? What's the cost of a slipped deal? What would you save if reps spent 10 fewer hours per week on admin? Let's run the numbers for your specific situation."

---

## Authority/Process Objections

### "I need to talk to my team/boss"
**Response**:
"Of course - this is a team decision. Who else needs to be involved? I'd love to help you present this internally. Would it be helpful if I provided a summary of what we discussed, or even joined a follow-up call with your team? What questions do you think they'll have?"

---

### "We have a long procurement process"
**Response**:
"We work with enterprise companies all the time and understand procurement. We can provide whatever documentation you need - security questionnaires, MSAs, SOC reports. Can you walk me through your process so I can prepare materials in advance? What typically slows things down?"

---

## Momentum Objections

### "Send me more information"
**Response**:
"Happy to. What specifically would be most helpful? Rather than a generic deck, I'd like to send something relevant to your situation. Would a case study from [their industry] be useful? Or would you prefer to see a short demo video first?"

---

### "Let me think about it"
**Response**:
"Of course - it's a big decision. To help you think it through, what are the main things you're weighing? Is there anything I can clarify or any concerns I haven't addressed? And what timeline are you working with for making a decision?"
