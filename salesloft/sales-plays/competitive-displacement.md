# Sales Play: Competitive Displacement

## Play Overview
This play is designed for prospects currently using a competitive solution (Outreach, Gong, Clari, or other sales tech) who may be open to evaluating alternatives.

## Trigger Signals
- Competitor contract renewal approaching (3-6 months out)
- Negative reviews or complaints about current tool
- New sales/RevOps leadership hired
- Missed revenue targets or forecasting issues
- Announced cost-cutting or consolidation initiatives
- Low adoption or usage of current tool
- Expansion needs current tool doesn't support

## Target Personas
**Primary**: RevOps, VP Sales, CRO
**Secondary**: Sales Manager, Sales Enablement

## Key Messages by Competitor

### Displacing Outreach
**Lead with**: Unified platform vs. modules, Drift chat, AI agents
**Opening**: "Many Outreach customers tell us they wanted a unified platform rather than modules, plus capabilities like website chat and AI agents that Outreach doesn't offer. What's your experience been?"

### Displacing Gong
**Lead with**: Full workflow platform vs. CI point solution, mature engagement
**Opening**: "Gong does conversation intelligence well, but we hear from customers they needed more - mature sales engagement, unified workflow, and AI across the full sales motion. Is CI alone meeting your needs?"

### Displacing Clari
**Lead with**: Engagement + forecasting together, AI agents
**Opening**: "Clari is strong on forecasting, but our customers wanted the engagement capabilities and AI agents in the same platform. Are you using a separate tool for sales engagement today?"

## Objection Handling

### "We're locked into our contract"
"When does it renew? We can start planning now and have everything ready for a smooth transition. Many customers run a proof of concept before their renewal to validate the switch."

### "The switching cost is too high"
"We offer migration services to make the transition smooth. And consider the ongoing cost of staying: if your current tool isn't delivering the results you need, what's that costing you in missed revenue? Our customers typically see ROI within the first quarter."

### "My team is trained on [competitor]"
"That's actually one of our strengths - Salesloft is designed to be intuitive. We have the fastest time to value in the industry. Reps are productive within days, not weeks. And we provide dedicated onboarding support."
