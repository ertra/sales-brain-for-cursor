## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Outreach
"Outreach is a good company - we compete with them frequently. The main differences our customers highlight are: 1) our AI agents that automate research and personalization, 2) Drift for website chat which Outreach doesn't offer, and 3) our unified platform approach vs. their modular setup. What's most important to you in this evaluation?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Outreach
1. Emphasize unified platform vs. modules
2. Demo AI agents (Account Research, Email Drafting)
3. Show Drift website chat capability
4. Share Forrester Wave positioning
5. Discuss implementation timeline differences

### Trap-Setting Questions
Questions that expose Outreach weaknesses:

1. "How are you planning to engage website visitors and convert them to pipeline?" (No Drift)
2. "How important is AI that automates research and drafts personalized emails?" (Limited AI agents)
3. "How quickly do you need to see results from the platform?" (Slower implementation)
4. "Are you looking to consolidate tools or add another point solution?" (Modular vs. unified)
