3. **Drift Chat**: Website chat Gong doesn't have
4. **25+ AI Agents**: More purpose-built agents
5. **Better Value**: More capabilities at better price point
6. **Revenue Orchestration**: Platform approach vs. intelligence layer

### Gong Claims vs Reality

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "Revenue Intelligence Platform" | Primarily conversation intelligence with add-ons | We're a true Revenue Orchestration Platform with unified workflow |
| "Gong Engage is full sales engagement" | New product, limited maturity | Our Cadence has years of refinement, 100M+ activities monthly |
| "Best-in-class call analytics" | True strength, but that's one piece | Conversation intelligence is part of our complete platform |

## Handling Competitive Situations

### If Prospect Mentions Gong
"Gong does conversation intelligence well - that's their core. The question is whether you want a CI tool with engagement bolted on, or a unified revenue platform where engagement, conversations, deals, and forecasting work together. Most of our customers prefer the unified approach. What's driving your interest in Gong?"

### If Prospect is Evaluating Gong
1. Position as unified platform vs. point solution
2. Demo Cadence depth vs. Gong Engage
3. Show AI agents across entire workflow
4. Emphasize total cost of ownership
5. Show Drift capabilities (no Gong equivalent)

### Trap-Setting Questions
Questions that expose Gong weaknesses:

1. "How mature is your current sales engagement/sequencing need?" (Gong Engage is new)
2. "Do you need website chat to convert visitors?" (No Gong solution)
3. "Is it important that everything works in one unified workflow?" (Gong is bolted together)
4. "What's your budget for sales technology?" (Gong is expensive for limited scope)

## Pricing Comparison
| | Salesloft | Gong |
|--|-----------|------|
| Model | Per user/month | Per user/month |
| Perception | Value leader | Premium priced |
| Key Differences | Full platform | CI core + add-ons |

## Displacement Strategy

### For Existing Gong Customers
- Don't lead with "replace Gong"
- Position as complementary initially (they can keep Gong for CI)
- Show value of unified engagement + deals + forecast
- Once in, demonstrate Conversations capability
- Natural consolidation over time

### Migration Path
1. Start with Cadence for engagement
2. Add Deals and Forecast
3. Enable Conversations
4. Evaluate Gong consolidation at renewal
