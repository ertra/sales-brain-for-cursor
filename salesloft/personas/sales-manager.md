## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I coach fine without a tool" | AI surfaces the coaching moments you'd miss - objection patterns, stalled deals, struggling reps - before it's too late |
| "Pipeline reviews work for us" | Imagine cutting that time in half. What would you do with those hours? |
| "My reps won't like being monitored" | It's not surveillance - it's enablement. Top performers love data on their wins. |
| "Forecasting is a CRM function" | CRM stores data. Salesloft AI analyzes it to tell you what will actually close. |

## Discovery Questions
